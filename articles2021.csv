0,Large fluctuations in multi-scale modeling for rest hematopoiesis,Hematopoiesis is a biological phenomenon  process  of production of mature blood cells by cellular differentiation  It is based on amplification steps due to an interplay between renewal and differentiation in the successive cell types from stem cells to mature blood cells  We will study this mechanism with a stochastic point of view to explain unexpected fluctuations on the mature blood cell number  as surprisingly observed by biologists and medical doctors in a rest hematopoiesis  We consider three cell types  stem cells  progenitors and mature blood cells  Each cell type is characterized by its own dynamics parameters  the division rate and the renewal and differentiation probabilities at each division event  We model the global population dynamics by a three dimensional stochastic decomposable branching process  We show that the amplification mechanism is given by the inverse of the small difference between the differentiation and renewal probabilities  Introducing a parameter K which scales simultaneously the size of the first component  the differentiation and renewal probabilities and the mature blood cell death rate  we describe the asymptotic behavior of the process for large K  We show that each cell type has its own size and time scales  Focusing on the third component  we prove that the mature blood cell population size  conveniently renormalized  in time and size   is expanded in an unusual way inducing large fluctuations  The proofs are based on a fine study of the different scales involved in the model and on the use of different convergence and average techniques in the proofs     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Bonnet C.; Méléard S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
1,Haldane’s formula in Cannings models: the case of moderately strong selection,For a class of Cannings models we prove Haldane s formula    sN   sN    for the fixation probability of a single beneficial mutant in the limit of large population size N and in the regime of moderately strong selection  i e  for sN  N b and 0   b         Here  sN is the selective advantage of an individual carrying the beneficial type  and    is the  asymptotic  offspring variance  Our assumptions on the reproduction mechanism allow for a coupling of the beneficial allele s frequency process with slightly supercritical Galton Watson processes in the early phase of fixation     0    The Author s  ,Boenkost F.; González Casanova A.; Pokalyuk C.; Wakolbinger A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
2,Vaccination and herd immunity thresholds in heterogeneous populations,It has been suggested  without rigorous mathematical analysis  that the classical vaccine induced herd immunity threshold  HIT  assuming a homogeneous population can be substantially higher than the minimum HIT obtained when considering population heterogeneities  We investigated this claim by developing  and rigorously analyzing  a vaccination model that incorporates various forms of heterogeneity and compared it with a model that considers a homogeneous population  By employing a two group vaccination model in heterogeneous populations  we theoretically established conditions under which heterogeneity leads to different HIT values  depending on the relative values of the contact rates for each group  the type of mixing between the groups  the relative vaccine efficacy  and the relative population size of each group  For example  under biased random mixing assumption and when vaccinating a given group results in disproportionate prevention of higher transmission per capita  we show that it is optimal to vaccinate that group before vaccinating the other groups  We also found situations  under biased assortative mixing assumption  where it is optimal to vaccinate more than one group  We show that regardless of the form of mixing between the groups  the HIT values assuming a heterogeneous population are always lower than the HIT values obtained from a corresponding model with a homogeneous population  Using realistic numerical examples and parametrization  e g   assuming assortative mixing together with vaccine efficacy of 9   and the value of the basic reproduction number  R  of the model set at R        we demonstrate that the HIT value generated from a model that considers population heterogeneity  e g   biased assortative mixing  is significantly lower   0   compared with a HIT value of     obtained if the model uses homogeneous population     0    Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Elbasha E.H.; Gumel A.B.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
3,Mathematical modeling of forest ecosystems by a reaction–diffusion–advection system: impacts of climate change and deforestation,We present an innovative mathematical model for studying the dynamics of forest ecosystems  Our model is determined by an age structured reaction diffusion advection system in which the roles of the water resource and of the atmospheric activity are considered  The model is abstract but constructed in such a manner that it can be applied to real world forest areas  thus it allows to establish an infinite number of scenarios for testing the robustness and resilience of forest ecosystems to anthropic actions or to climate change  We establish the well posedness of the reaction diffusion advection model by using the method of characteristics and by reducing the initial system to a reaction diffusion problem  The existence and stability of stationary homogeneous and stationary heterogeneous solutions are investigated  so as to prove that the model is able to reproduce relevant equilibrium states of the forest ecosystem  We show that the model fits with the principle of almost uniform precipitation over forested areas and of exponential decrease of precipitation over deforested areas  Furthermore  we present a selection of numerical simulations for an abstract forest ecosystem  in order to analyze the stability of the steady states  to investigate the impact of anthropic perturbations such as deforestation and to explore the effects of climate change on the dynamics of the forest ecosystem     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Cantin G.; Ducrot A.; Funatsu B.M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
4,Modelling the interplay between the CD4 + /CD8 + T-cell ratio and the expression of MHC-I in tumours,Describing the anti tumour immune response as a series of cellular kinetic reactions from known immunological mechanisms  we create a mathematical model that shows the CD + CD + T cell ratio  T cell infiltration and the expression of MHC I to be interacting factors in tumour elimination  Methods from dynamical systems theory and non equilibrium statistical mechanics are used to model the T cell dependent anti tumour immune response  Our model predicts a critical level of MHC I expression which determines whether or not the tumour escapes the immune response  This critical level of MHC I depends on the helper cytotoxic T cell ratio  However  our model also suggests that the immune system is robust against small changes in this ratio  We also find that T cell infiltration and the specificity of the intra tumour TCR repertoire will affect the critical MHC I expression  Our work suggests that the functional form of the time evolution of MHC I expression may explain the qualitative behaviour of tumour growth seen in patients     0    The Author s  ,Hurry C.J.; Mozeika A.; Annibale A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
5,The structure of infinitesimal homeostasis in input–output networks,Homeostasis refers to a phenomenon whereby the output xo of a system is approximately constant on variation of an input I  Homeostasis occurs frequently in biochemical networks and in other networks of interacting elements where mathematical models are based on differential equations associated to the network  These networks can be abstracted as digraphs G with a distinguished input node    a different distinguished output node o  and a number of regulatory nodes          n  In these models the input output map xo I  is defined by a stable equilibrium X at I  Stability implies that there is a stable equilibrium X I  for each I near I and infinitesimal homeostasis occurs at I when  dxo  dI   I    0  We show that there is an  n+       n+    homeostasis matrixH I  for which dxo  dI  0 if and only if det  H    0  We note that the entries in H are linearized couplings and det  H  is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n+   in these entries  We use combinatorial matrix theory to factor the polynomial det  H  and thereby determine a menu of different types of possible homeostasis associated with each digraph G  Specifically  we prove that each factor corresponds to a subnetwork of G  The factors divide into two combinatorially defined classes  structural and appendage  Structural factors correspond to feedforward motifs and appendage factors correspond to feedback motifs  Finally  we discover an algorithm for determining the homeostasis subnetwork motif corresponding to each factor of det  H  without performing numerical simulations on model equations  The algorithm allows us to classify low degree factors of det  H   There are two types of degree   homeostasis  negative feedback loops and kinetic or Haldane motifs  and there are two types of degree   homeostasis  feedforward loops and a degree two appendage motif      0    The Author s  ,Wang Y.; Huang Z.; Antoneli F.; Golubitsky M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
6,Bayesian inversion of a diffusion model with application to biology,A common task in experimental sciences is to fit mathematical models to real world measurements to improve understanding of natural phenomenon  reverse engineering or inverse modelling   When complex dynamical systems are considered  such as partial differential equations  this task may become challenging or ill posed  In this work  a linear parabolic equation is considered as a model for protein transcription from MRNA  The objective is to estimate jointly the differential operator coefficients  namely the rates of diffusion and self regulation  as well as a functional source  The recent Bayesian methodology for infinite dimensional inverse problems is applied  providing a unique posterior distribution on the parameter space continuous in the data  This posterior is then summarized using a Maximum a Posteriori estimator  Finally  the theoretical solution is illustrated using a state of the art MCMC algorithm adapted to this non Gaussian setting     0    The Author s  ,Croix J.-C.; Durrande N.; Alvarez M.A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
7,A geometric analysis of the SIRS epidemiological model on a homogeneous network,We study a fast slow version of an SIRS epidemiological model on homogeneous graphs  obtained through the application of the moment closure method  We use GSPT to study the model  taking into account that the infection period is much shorter than the average duration of immunity  We show that the dynamics occurs through a sequence of fast and slow flows  that can be described through   dimensional maps that  under some assumptions  can be approximated as   dimensional maps  Using this method  together with numerical bifurcation tools  we show that the model can give rise to periodic solutions  differently from the corresponding model based on homogeneous mixing     0    The Author s  ,Jardón-Kojakhmetov H.; Kuehn C.; Pugliese A.; Sensi M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
8,Hive geometry shapes the recruitment rate of honeybee colonies,Honey bees make decisions regarding foraging and nest site selection in groups ranging from hundreds to thousands of individuals  To effectively make these decisions  bees need to communicate within a spatially distributed group  However  the spatiotemporal dynamics of honey bee communication have been mostly overlooked in models of collective decisions  focusing primarily on mean field models of opinion dynamics  We analyze how the spatial properties of the nest or hive  and the movement of individuals with different belief states  uncommitted or committed  therein affect the rate of information transmission using spatially extended models of collective decision making within a hive  Honeybees waggle dance to recruit conspecifics with an intensity that is a threshold nonlinear function of the waggler concentration  Our models range from treating the hive as a chain of discrete patches to a continuous line  long narrow hive   The combination of population thresholded recruitment and compartmentalized populations generates tradeoffs between rapid information propagation with strong population dispersal and recruitment failures resulting from excessive population diffusion and also creates an effective colony level signal detection mechanism whereby recruitment to low quality objectives is blocked     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Bidari S.; Kilpatrick Z.P.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
9,Stochastic models of infectious diseases in a periodic environment with application to cholera epidemics,Seasonal variation affects the dynamics of many infectious diseases including influenza  cholera and malaria  The time when infectious individuals are first introduced into a population is crucial in predicting whether a major disease outbreak occurs  In this investigation  we apply a time nonhomogeneous stochastic process for a cholera epidemic with seasonal periodicity and a multitype branching process approximation to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of an outbreak  In particular  an analytic estimate of the probability of disease extinction is shown to satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations which follows from the backward Kolmogorov differential equation  An explicit expression for the mean  resp  variance  of the first extinction time given an extinction occurs is derived based on the analytic estimate for the extinction probability  Our results indicate that the probability of a disease outbreak  and mean and standard derivation of the first time to disease extinction are periodic in time and depend on the time when the infectious individuals or free living pathogens are introduced  Numerical simulations are then carried out to validate the analytical predictions using two examples of the general cholera model  At the end  the developed theoretical results are extended to more general models of infectious diseases     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Allen L.J.S.; Wang X.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
10,Is our breathing optimal? Solving a piecewise linear model with constraints,This paper is motivated by a question related to the control of amplitude and frequency of breathing  We present a simplified mathematical model  consisting of two piecewise linear ordinary differential equations  that could represent gas exchange in the lungs  We then define and solve an optimal control problem with unknown durations of inhalation and exhalation  subject to several constraints  The durations are divided such that one of the state variables is strictly increasing during the first phase and decreasing during the second phase  The optimal control problem can be solved analytically  One analytical solution is found when the forcing is a given sinusoidal function with unknown period and amplitude  Other analytical solutions are found when the forcing function  the period and the duration of the first phase are unknown but the amplitude is given  Our results show that different cost functions can produce different optimal forcing functions  We also show that the shape of these functions does not affect the average levels of oxygen in the lungs the average level of oxygen is only dependent on the amplitude and period of breathing in the model we present     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Zaidi F.; Ben-Tal A.; Roberts M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
11,On convergence for hybrid models of gene regulatory networks under polytopic uncertainties: a Lyapunov approach,Hybrid models of genetic regulatory networks allow for a simpler analysis with respect to fully detailed quantitative models  still maintaining the main dynamical features of interest  In this paper we consider a piecewise affine model of a genetic regulatory network  in which the parameters describing the production function are affected by polytopic uncertainties  In the first part of the paper  after recalling how the problem of finding a Lyapunov function is solved in the nominal case  we present the considered polytopic uncertain system and then  after describing how to deal with sliding mode solutions  we prove a result of existence of a parameter dependent Lyapunov function subject to the solution of a feasibility linear matrix inequalities problem  In the second part of the paper  based on the previously described Lyapunov function  we are able to determine a set of domains where the system is guaranteed to converge  with the exception of a zero measure set of times  independently from the uncertainty realization  Finally a three nodes network example shows the validity of the results     0    The Author s  ,Pasquini M.; Angeli D.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
12,Multivariate phase-type theory for the site frequency spectrum,Linear functions of the site frequency spectrum  SFS  play a major role for understanding and investigating genetic diversity  Estimators of the mutation rate  e g  based on the total number of segregating sites or average of the pairwise differences  and tests for neutrality  e g  Tajima s D  are perhaps the most well known examples  The distribution of linear functions of the SFS is important for constructing confidence intervals for the estimators  and to determine significance thresholds for neutrality tests  These distributions are often approximated using simulation procedures  In this paper we use multivariate phase type theory to specify  characterize and calculate the distribution of linear functions of the site frequency spectrum  In particular  we show that many of the classical estimators of the mutation rate are distributed according to a discrete phase type distribution  Neutrality tests  however  are generally not discrete phase type distributed  For neutrality tests we derive the probability generating function using continuous multivariate phase type theory  and numerically invert the function to obtain the distribution  A main result is an analytically tractable formula for the probability generating function of the SFS  Software implementation of the phase type methodology is available in the R package PhaseTypeR  and R code for the reproduction of our results is available as an accompanying vignette     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Hobolth A.; Bladt M.; Andersen L.N.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
13,A stochastic eco-epidemiological system with patchy structure and transport-related infection,In this paper  a stochastic eco epidemiological system with patchy structure and transport related infection is proposed and the stochastic dynamical behaviors are investigated  Firstly  by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions  it is revealed that there is a unique globally positive solution starting from the positive initial value  Secondly  it is proved that the presented system is stochastically ultimately bounded and the average in time of the second moment of solution is bounded  Thirdly  we prove that the large enough stochastic perturbations may lead the predator population and the diseases in the predator to be extinct while it is persistent in the deterministic system  Finally  some numerical simulations are given to test our theoretical results     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Ma Z.; Han S.; Li S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
14,Modeling the voltage distribution in a non-locally but globally electroneutral confined electrolyte medium: applications for nanophysiology,The distribution of voltage in sub micron cellular domains remains poorly understood  In neurons  the voltage results from the difference in ionic concentrations which are continuously maintained by pumps and exchangers  However  it not clear how electro neutrality could be maintained by an excess of fast moving positive ions that should be counter balanced by slow diffusing negatively charged proteins  Using the theory of electro diffusion  we study here the voltage distribution in a generic domain  which consists of two concentric disks  resp  ball  in two  resp  three  dimensions  where a negative charge is fixed in the inner domain  When global but not local electro neutrality is maintained  we solve the Poisson Nernst Planck equation both analytically and numerically in dimension    flat  and    cylindrical  and found that the voltage changes considerably on a spatial scale which is much larger than the Debye screening length  which assumes electro neutrality  The present result suggests that long range voltage drop changes are expected in neuronal microcompartments  probably relevant to explain the activation of far away voltage gated channels located on the surface membrane     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Tricot A.; Sokolov I.M.; Holcman D.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
15,Parameter estimation in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching: quantitative analysis of protein binding reactions and diffusion,Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  FRAP  is a common experimental method for investigating rates of molecular redistribution in biological systems  Many mathematical models of FRAP have been developed  the purpose of which is usually the estimation of certain biological parameters such as the diffusivity and chemical reaction rates of a protein  this being accomplished by fitting the model to experimental data  In this article  we consider a two species reaction diffusion FRAP model  Using asymptotic analysis  we derive new FRAP recovery curve approximation formulae  and formally re derive existing ones  On the basis of these formulae  invoking the concept of Fisher information  we predict  in terms of biological and experimental parameters  sufficient conditions to ensure that the values all model parameters can be estimated from data  We verify our predictions with extensive computational simulations  We also use computational methods to investigate cases in which some or all biological parameters are theoretically inestimable  In these cases  we propose methods which can be used to extract the maximum possible amount of information from the FRAP data     0    The Author s  ,Williamson D.E.; Sahai E.; Jenkins R.P.; O’Dea R.D.; King J.R.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
16,Evolutionary bet-hedging in structured populations,As ecosystems evolve  species can become extinct due to fluctuations in the environment  This leads to the evolutionary adaption known as bet hedging  where species hedge against these fluctuations to reduce their likelihood of extinction  Environmental variation can be either within or between generations  Previous work has shown that selection for bet hedging against within generational variation should not occur in large populations  However  this work has been limited by assumptions of well mixed populations  whereas real populations usually have some degree of structure  Using the framework of evolutionary graph theory  we show that through adding competition structure to the population  within generational variation can have a significant impact on the evolutionary process for any population size  This complements research using subdivided populations  which suggests that within generational variation is important when local population sizes are small  Together  these conclusions provide evidence to support observations by some ecologists that are contrary to the widely held view that only between generational environmental variation has an impact on natural selection  This provides theoretical justification for further empirical study into this largely unexplored area     0    The Author s  ,Overton C.E.; Sharkey K.J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
17,Geometric singular perturbation theory analysis of an epidemic model with spontaneous human behavioral change,We consider a model due to Piero Poletti and collaborators that adds spontaneous human behavioral change to the standard SIR epidemic model  In its simplest form  the Poletti model adds one differential equation  motivated by evolutionary game theory  to the SIR model  The new equation describes the evolution of a variable x that represents the fraction of the population following normal behavior  The remaining fraction     x uses altered behavior such as staying home  social isolation  mask wearing  etc  Normal behavior offers a higher payoff when the number of infectives is low  altered behavior offers a higher payoff when the number is high  We show that the entry exit function of geometric singular perturbation theory can be used to analyze the model in the limit in which behavior changes on a much faster time scale than that of the epidemic  In particular  behavior does not change as soon as a different behavior has a higher payoff  current behavior is sticky  The delay until behavior changes is predicted by the entry exit function     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Schecter S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
18,Spectral properties of a non-compact operator in ecology,Ecologists have recently used integral projection models  IPMs  to study fish and other animals which continue to grow throughout their lives  Such animals cannot shrink  since they have bony skeletons  a mathematical consequence of this is that the kernel of the integral projection operator T is unbounded  and the operator is not compact  To our knowledge  all theoretical work done on IPMs has assumed the operator is compact  and in particular has a bounded kernel  A priori  it is unclear whether these IPMs have an asymptotic growth rate    or a stable stage distribution    In the case of a compact operator  these quantities are its spectral radius and the associated eigenvector  respectively  Under biologically reasonable assumptions  we prove that the non compact operators in these IPMs share some important traits with their compact counterparts  the operator T has a unique positive eigenvector   corresponding to its spectral radius    this   is strictly greater than the supremum of the modulus of all other spectral values  and for any nonnegative initial population    there is a c  0 such that Tn    n  c        0    This is a U S  government work and not under copyright protection in the U S   foreign copyright protection may apply ,Reichenbach M.; Rebarber R.; Tenhumberg B.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
19,On asymptotic joint distributions of cherries and pitchforks for random phylogenetic trees,Tree shape statistics provide valuable quantitative insights into evolutionary mechanisms underpinning phylogenetic trees  a commonly used graph representation of evolutionary relationships among taxonomic units ranging from viruses to species  We study two subtree counting statistics  the number of cherries and the number of pitchforks  for random phylogenetic trees generated by two widely used null tree models  the proportional to distinguishable arrangements  PDA  and the Yule Harding Kingman  YHK  models  By developing limit theorems for a version of extended P lya urn models in which negative entries are permitted for their replacement matrices  we deduce the strong laws of large numbers and the central limit theorems for the joint distributions of these two counting statistics for the PDA and the YHK models  Our results indicate that the limiting behaviour of these two statistics  when appropriately scaled using the number of leaves in the underlying trees  is independent of the initial tree used in the tree generating process     0    The Author s  ,Choi K.P.; Kaur G.; Wu T.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
20,Analysis of a mathematical model of immune response to fungal infection,Fungi are cells found as commensal residents  on the skin  and on mucosal surfaces of the human body  including the digestive track and urogenital track  but some species are pathogenic  Fungal infection may spread into deep seated organs causing life threatening infection  especially in immune compromised individuals  Effective defense against fungal infection requires a coordinated response by the innate and adaptive immune systems  In the present paper we introduce a simple mathematical model of immune response to fungal infection consisting of three partial differential equations  for the populations of fungi  F   neutrophils  N  and cytotoxic T cells  T   taking N and T to represent  respectively  the innate and adaptive immune cells  We denote by  F the aggressive proliferation rate of the fungi  by   and   the killing rates of fungi by neutrophils and T cells  and by N and T the immune strengths  respectively  of N and T of an infected individual  We take the expression I   N+  T   F to represent the coordinated defense of the immune system against fungal infection  We use mathematical analysis to prove the following  If I  0   then the infection is eventually stopped  and F  0 as t     and  ii  if I  0 then the infection cannot be stopped and F converges to some positive constant as t     Treatments of fungal infection include anti fungal agents and immunotherapy drugs  and both cause the parameter I to increase     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Friedman A.; Lam K.-Y.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
21,Stationary distributions of persistent ecological systems,We analyze ecological systems that are influenced by random environmental fluctuations  We first provide general conditions which ensure that the species coexist and the system converges to a unique invariant probability measure  stationary distribution   Since it is usually impossible to characterize this invariant probability measure analytically  we develop a powerful method for numerically approximating invariant probability measures  This allows us to shed light upon how the various parameters of the ecosystem impact the stationary distribution  We analyze different types of environmental fluctuations  At first we study ecosystems modeled by stochastic differential equations  In the second setting we look at piecewise deterministic Markov processes  These are processes where one follows a system of differential equations for a random time  after which the environmental state changes  and one follows a different set of differential equations this procedure then gets repeated indefinitely  Finally  we look at stochastic differential equations with switching  which take into account both the white noise fluctuations and the random environmental switches  As applications of our theoretical and numerical analysis  we look at competitive Lotka Volterra  Beddington DeAngelis predator prey  and rock paper scissors dynamics  We highlight new biological insights by analyzing the stationary distributions of the ecosystems and by seeing how various types of environmental fluctuations influence the long term fate of populations     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Hening A.; Li Y.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
22,"Exploring the sensitivity in jellyfish locomotion under variations in scale, frequency, and duty cycle",Jellyfish have been called one of the most energy efficient animals in the world due to the ease in which they move through their fluid environment  by product of their bell kinematics coupled with their morphological  muscular  material properties  We investigated jellyfish locomotion by conducting in silico comparative studies and explored swimming performance across different fluid scales  i e   Reynolds Number   bell contraction frequencies  and contraction phase kinematics  duty cycle  for a jellyfish with a fineness ratio of    ratio of bell height to bell diameter   To study these relationships  an open source implementation of the immersed boundary method was used  IB d  to solve the fully coupled fluid structure interaction problem of a flexible jellyfish bell in a viscous fluid  Thorough  D parameter subspace explorations illustrated optimal parameter combinations in which give rise to enhanced swimming performance  All performance metrics indicated a higher sensitivity to bell actuation frequency than fluid scale or duty cycle  via Sobol sensitivity analysis  on a higher performance parameter subspace  Moreover  Pareto like fronts were identified in the overall performance space involving the cost of transport and forward swimming speed  Patterns emerged within these performance spaces when highlighting different parameter regions  which complemented the global sensitivity results  Lastly  an open source computational model for jellyfish locomotion is offered to the science community that can be used as a starting place for future numerical experimentation     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Miles J.G.; Battista N.A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
23,Adaptation in a heterogeneous environment I: persistence versus extinction,Understanding how a diversity of plants in agroecosystems affects the adaptation of pathogens is a key issue in agroecology  We analyze PDE systems describing the dynamics of adaptation of two phenotypically structured populations  under the effects of mutation  selection and migration in a two patch environment  each patch being associated with a different phenotypic optimum  We consider two types of growth functions that depend on the n dimensional phenotypic trait  either local and linear or nonlocal nonlinear  In both cases  we obtain existence and uniqueness results as well as a characterization of the large time behaviour of the solution  persistence or extinction  based on the sign of a principal eigenvalue  We show that migration between the two environments decreases the chances of persistence  with in some cases a  lethal migration threshold  above which persistence is not possible  Comparison with stochastic individual based simulations shows that the PDE approach accurately captures this threshold  Our results illustrate the importance of cultivar mixtures for disease prevention and control     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Hamel F.; Lavigne F.; Roques L.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
24,Reduction of a stochastic model of gene expression: Lagrangian dynamics gives access to basins of attraction as cell types and metastabilty,Differentiation is the process whereby a cell acquires a specific phenotype  by differential gene expression as a function of time  This is thought to result from the dynamical functioning of an underlying Gene Regulatory Network  GRN   The precise path from the stochastic GRN behavior to the resulting cell state is still an open question  In this work we propose to reduce a stochastic model of gene expression  where a cell is represented by a vector in a continuous space of gene expression  to a discrete coarse grained model on a limited number of cell types  We develop analytical results and numerical tools to perform this reduction for a specific model characterizing the evolution of a cell by a system of piecewise deterministic Markov processes  PDMP   Solving a spectral problem  we find the explicit variational form of the rate function associated to a large deviations principle  for any number of genes  The resulting Lagrangian dynamics allows us to define a deterministic limit of which the basins of attraction can be identified to cellular types  In this context the quasipotential  describing the transitions between these basins in the weak noise limit  can be defined as the unique solution of an Hamilton Jacobi equation under a particular constraint  We develop a numerical method for approximating the coarse grained model parameters  and show its accuracy for a symmetric toggle switch network  We deduce from the reduced model an approximation of the stationary distribution of the PDMP system  which appears as a Beta mixture  Altogether those results establish a rigorous frame for connecting GRN behavior to the resulting cellular behavior  including the calculation of the probability of jumps between cell types     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Ventre E.; Espinasse T.; Bréhier C.-E.; Calvez V.; Lepoutre T.; Gandrillon O.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
25,Deterministic and stochastic modeling for PDGF-driven gliomas reveals a classification of gliomas,Motivated by our study of infiltrating dynamics of immune cells into tumors  we propose a stochastic model in terms of Ito stochastic differential equations to study how two parameters  the chemoattractant production rate and the chemotactic coefficient  influence immune cell migration and how these parameters distinguish two types of gliomas  We conduct a detailed analysis of the stochastic model and its deterministic counterpart  The deterministic model can differentiate two types of gliomas according to the range of the chemoattractant production rate as two equilibrium solutions  while the stochastic model also can differentiate two types of gliomas according to the ranges of the chemoattractant production rate and chemotactic coefficient with thresholds as one non zero ergodic invariant measure and one weak persistent state when the noise intensities are small  When the noise intensities are large comparing with the chemotactic coefficient  there is only one type of glioma that corresponds to a non zero ergodic invariant measure  Using our experimental data  numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate properties of our models  and we give medical interpretations and implications for our analytical results and numerical simulations  This study also confirms some of our results about IDH gliomas     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Phan T.A.; Nguyen H.D.; Tian J.P.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
26,Treatment-induced shrinking of tumour aggregates: a nonlinear volume-filling chemotactic approach,Motivated by experimental observations in  D organoid cultures derived from glioblastoma  we propose a novel mechano transduction mechanism where the introduction of a chemotherapeutic treatment induces mechanical changes at the cell level  We analyse the influence of these individual mechanical changes on the properties of the aggregates obtained at the population level  We employ a nonlinear volume filling chemotactic system of partial differential equations  where the elastic properties of the cells are taken into account through the so called squeezing probability  which depends on the concentration of the treatment in the extracellular microenvironment  We explore two scenarios for the effect of the treatment  first  we suppose that the treatment acts only on the mechanical properties of the cells and  in the second one  we assume it also prevents cell proliferation  We perform a linear stability analysis which enables us to identify the ability of the system to create patterns and fully characterize their size  Moreover  we provide numerical simulations in  D and  D that illustrate the shrinking of the aggregates due to the presence of the treatment     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Almeida L.; Estrada-Rodriguez G.; Oliver L.; Peurichard D.; Poulain A.; Vallette F.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
27,Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental epidemic models,The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic  Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease  The importance of social structure  such as the age dependence that proved essential in the recent COVID  9 pandemic  must be considered  and in addition  the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous  so a high degree of uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning  In this work we address these aspects  through an optimal control formulation of a socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data  After the introduction of the optimal control problem  we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction  The need for long term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy  The timing and intensity of interventions  however  is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people  Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID  9 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed     0    The Author s  ,Albi G.; Pareschi L.; Zanella M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

29,An investigation of tuberculosis progression revealing the role of macrophages apoptosis via sensitivity and bifurcation analysis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection features various disease outcomes  clearance  latency  active disease  and latent tuberculosis infection  LTBI  reactivation  Identifying the decisive factors for disease outcomes and progression is crucial to elucidate the macrophages tuberculosis interaction and provide insights into therapeutic strategies  To achieve this goal  we first model the disease progression as a dynamical shift among different disease outcomes  which are characterized by various steady states of bacterial concentration  The causal mechanisms of steady state transitions can be the occurrence of transcritical and saddle node bifurcations  which are induced by slowly changing parameters  Transcritical bifurcation  occurring when the basic reproduction number equals to one  determines whether the infection clears or spreads  Saddle node bifurcation is the key mechanism to create and destroy steady states  Based on these two steady state transition mechanisms  we carry out two sample based sensitivity analyses on transcritical bifurcation conditions and saddle node bifurcation conditions  The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the macrophage apoptosis rate is the most significant factor affecting the transition in disease outcomes  This result agrees with the discovery that the programmed cell death  apoptosis  plays a unique role in the complex microorganism host interplay  Sensitivity analysis narrows down the parameters of interest  but cannot answer how these parameters influence the model outcomes  To do this  we employ bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation to unfold various disease outcomes induced by the variation of macrophage apoptosis rate  Our findings support the hypothesis that the regulation mechanism of macrophage apoptosis affects the host immunity against tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis virulence  Moreover  our mathematical results suggest that new treatments and or vaccines that regulate macrophage apoptosis in combination with weakening bacillary viability and or promoting adaptive immunity could have therapeutic value     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Zhang W.; Ellingson L.; Frascoli F.; Heffernan J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
30,Discrete coalescent trees,In many phylogenetic applications  such as cancer and virus evolution  time trees  evolutionary histories where speciation events are timed  are inferred  Of particular interest are clock like trees  where all leaves are sampled at the same time and have equal distance to the root  One popular approach to model clock like trees is coalescent theory  which is used in various tree inference software packages  Methodologically  phylogenetic inference methods require a tree space over which the inference is performed  and the geometry of this space plays an important role in statistical and computational aspects of tree inference algorithms  It has recently been shown that coalescent tree spaces possess a unique geometry  different from that of classical phylogenetic tree spaces  Here we introduce and study a space of discrete coalescent trees  They assume that time is discrete  which is natural in many computational applications  This tree space is a generalisation of the previously studied ranked nearest neighbour interchange space  and is built upon tree rearrangement operations  We generalise existing results about ranked trees  including an algorithm for computing distances in polynomial time  and in particular provide new results for both the space of discrete coalescent trees and the space of ranked trees  We establish several geometrical properties of these spaces and show how these properties impact various algorithms used in phylogenetic analyses  Our tree space is a discretisation of a previously introduced time tree space  called t space  and hence our results can be used to approximate solutions to various open problems in t space     0    The Author s  ,Collienne L.; Elmes K.; Fischer M.; Bryant D.; Gavryushkin A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
31,An alternative delayed population growth difference equation model,We propose an alternative delayed population growth difference equation model based on a modification of the Beverton Holt recurrence  assuming a delay only in the growth contribution that takes into account that those individuals that die during the delay  do not contribute to growth  The model introduced differs from a delayed logistic difference equation  known as the delayed Pielou or delayed Beverton Holt model  that was formulated as a discretization of the Hutchinson model  The analysis of our delayed difference equation model identifies a critical delay threshold  If the time delay exceeds this threshold  the model predicts that the population will go extinct for all non negative initial conditions  If the delay is below this threshold  the population survives and its size converges to a positive globally asymptotically stable equilibrium that is decreasing in size as the delay increases  We show global asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium using two different techniques  For one set of parameter values  a contraction mapping result is applied  while the proof for the remaining set of parameter values  relies on showing that the map is eventually componentwise monotone     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Streipert S.H.; Wolkowicz G.S.K.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

35,A binary search scheme for determining all contaminated specimens,Specimens are collected from N different sources  Each specimen has probability p of being contaminated  in the case of a disease  e g   p is the prevalence rate   independently of the other specimens  Suppose we can apply group testing  namely take small portions from several specimens  mix them together  and test the mixture for contamination  so that if the test turns positive  then at least one of the samples in the mixture is contaminated  In this paper we give a detailed probabilistic analysis of a binary search scheme  we propose  for determining all contaminated specimens  More precisely  we study the number T N  of tests required in order to find all the contaminated specimens  if this search scheme is applied  We derive recursive and  in some cases  explicit formulas for the expectation  the variance  and the characteristic function of T N   Also  we determine the asymptotic behavior of the moments of T N  as N    and from that we obtain the limiting distribution of T N   appropriately normalized   which turns out to be normal     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Papanicolaou V.G.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

37,Demographic feedbacks can hamper the spatial spread of a gene drive,This paper is concerned with a reaction diffusion system modeling the fixation and the invasion in a population of a gene drive  an allele biasing inheritance  increasing its own transmission to offspring   In our model  the gene drive has a negative effect on the fitness of individuals carrying it  and is therefore susceptible of decreasing the total carrying capacity of the population locally in space  This tends to generate an opposing demographic advection that the gene drive has to overcome in order to invade  While previous reaction diffusion models neglected this aspect  here we focus on it and try to predict the sign of the traveling wave speed  It turns out to be an analytical challenge  only partial results being within reach  and we complete our theoretical analysis by numerical simulations  Our results indicate that taking into account the interplay between population dynamics and population genetics might actually be crucial  as it can effectively reverse the direction of the invasion and lead to failure  Our findings can be extended to other bistable systems  such as the spread of cytoplasmic incompatibilities caused by Wolbachia     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Girardin L.; Débarre F.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

39,Assessment of event-triggered policies of nonpharmaceutical interventions based on epidemiological indicators,Nonpharmaceutical interventions  NPI  such as banning public events or instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the current COVID  9 pandemic  Typically  this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold  Then  the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently  What is the best indicator to use  In this paper  we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question  More specifically  the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators  Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible  The peak demand for intensive care units  ICU  and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes  If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions  there is naturally a trade off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used  The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators  This methodology is illustrated with indicators in the context of COVID  9 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete time  although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Castillo-Laborde C.; de Wolff T.; Gajardo P.; Lecaros R.; Olivar-Tost G.; Ramírez C H.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

43,On inferring evolutionary stability in finite populations using infinite population models,Models of evolution by natural selection often make the simplifying assumption that populations are infinitely large  In this infinite population limit  rare mutations that are selected against always go extinct  whereas in finite populations they can persist and even reach fixation  Nevertheless  for mutations of arbitrarily small phenotypic effect  it is widely believed that in sufficiently large populations  if selection opposes the invasion of rare mutants  then it also opposes their fixation  Here  we identify circumstances under which infinite population models do or do not accurately predict evolutionary outcomes in large  finite populations  We show that there is no population size above which considering only invasion generally suffices  for any finite population size  there are situations in which selection opposes the invasion of mutations of arbitrarily small effect  but favours their fixation  This is not an unlikely limiting case  it can occur when fitness is a smooth function of the evolving trait  and when the selection process is biologically sensible  Nevertheless  there are circumstances under which opposition of invasion does imply opposition of fixation  in fact  for the n player snowdrift game  a common model of cooperation  we identify sufficient conditions under which selection against rare mutants of small effect precludes their fixation in sufficiently large populations for any selection process  We also find conditions under which no matter how large the population the trait that fixes depends on the selection process  which is important because any particular selection process is only an approximation of reality     0    The Author s  ,Molina C.; Earn D.J.D.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

45,Solving the chemical master equation for monomolecular reaction systems and beyond: a Doi-Peliti path integral view,The chemical master equation  CME  is a fundamental description of interacting molecules commonly used to model chemical kinetics and noisy gene regulatory networks  Exact time dependent solutions of the CME which typically consists of infinitely many coupled differential equations are rare  and are valuable for numerical benchmarking and getting intuition for the behavior of more complicated systems  Jahnke and Huisinga s landmark calculation of the exact time dependent solution of the CME for monomolecular reaction systems is one of the most general analytic results known  however  it is hard to generalize  because it relies crucially on special properties of monomolecular reactions  In this paper  we rederive Jahnke and Huisinga s result on the time dependent probability distribution and moments of monomolecular reaction systems using the Doi Peliti path integral approach  which reduces solving the CME to evaluating many integrals  While the Doi Peliti approach is less intuitive  it is also more mechanical  and hence easier to generalize  To illustrate how the Doi Peliti approach can go beyond the method of Jahnke and Huisinga  we also find an explicit and exact time dependent solution to a problem involving an autocatalytic reaction that Jahnke and Huisinga identified as not solvable using their method  Most interestingly  we are able to find a formal exact time dependent solution for any CME whose list of reactions involves only zero and first order reactions  which may be the most general result currently known  This formal solution also yields a useful algorithm for efficiently computing numerical solutions to CMEs of this type     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Vastola J.J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

Mathematical modeling of circadian regulation on glucose metabolism,Synchronization of metabolic rhythms regulated by circadian clock and meal timing is essential for maintaining nutrient homeostasis in response to fluctuating food intake in animals  Despite numerous experimental findings on the involvement of circadian regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism  the optimal regulatory strategy for the maintenance of energy homeostasis remains poorly defined  A mathematical framework is useful to assess the circadian regulation of glycogen production breakdown and de novo lipogenesis lipolysis by evaluating the contribution of time of the day dependent activation or the repression of each metabolic process in the maintenance of energy homeostasis  Here  we present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of glycogen and triglyceride contents  two major forms of energy storage in the body that provide the fuel needed during different phases of food deprivation  By changing peak phases of glycogenesis and fat synthesis  we searched for the optimal phase set that minimizes the risks of two types of possible metabolic dysfunctions      high blood glucose and     energy exhaustion  Based on the optimal phase set  we compared the level of fat accumulation between meal timing in the active and resting periods  Our results showed that an increased fat accumulation by food intake in the resting period can be the byproduct of minimizing energy homeostasis risks in the synchronized feeding schedule that animals adopt in nature  Our finding will be useful to schedule an optimal meal timing to prevent metabolic diseases caused by misalignment of biological and social time in modern society     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Hara A.; Satake A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

56,A systematic search for switch-like behavior in type II toxin–antitoxin systems,Bistable switch like behavior is a ubiquitous feature of gene regulatory networks with decision making capabilities  Type II toxin antitoxin  TA  systems are hypothesized to facilitate a bistable switch in toxin concentration that influences the dormancy transition in persister cells  However  a series of recent retractions has raised fundamental questions concerning the exact mechanism of toxin propagation in persister cells and the relationship between type II TA systems and cellular dormancy  Through a careful modeling search  we identify how sp  bistablilty can emerge in type II TA systems by systematically modifying a basic model for the RelBE system with other common biological mechanisms  Our systematic search uncovers a new combination of mechanisms influencing bistability in type II TA systems and explores how toxin bistability emerges through synergistic interactions between paired type II TA systems  Our analysis also illustrates how Descartes  rule of signs and the resultant can be used as a powerful delineator of bistability in mathematical systems regardless of application     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,FitzGerald C.E.; Keener J.P.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
57,Towards a replicator dynamics model of age structured populations,We present a new modelling framework combining replicator dynamics  the standard model of frequency dependent selection  with an age structured population model  The new framework allows for the modelling of populations consisting of competing strategies carried by individuals who change across their life cycle  Firstly the discretization of the McKendrick von Foerster model is derived  We show that the Euler Lotka equation is satisfied when the new model reaches a steady state  i e  stable frequencies between the age classes   This discretization consists of unit age classes where the timescale is chosen so that only a fraction of individuals play a single game round  This implies a linear dynamics and individuals not killed during the round are moved to the next age class  linearity means that the system is equivalent to a large Bernadelli Lewis Leslie matrix  Then we use the methodology of multipopulation games to derive two  mutually equivalent systems of equations  The first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy frequencies in the whole population  completed by subsystems of equations describing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy  The second contains equations describing the changes of the general population s age structure  completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection of the strategies within each age class  We then present the obtained system of replicator dynamics in the form of the mixed ODE PDE system which is independent of the chosen timescale  and much simpler  The obtained results are illustrated by the example of the sex ratio model which shows that when different mortalities of the sexes are assumed  the sex ratio of 0   is obtained but that Fisher s mechanism  driven by the reproductive value of the different sexes  is not in equilibrium     0    The Author s  ,Argasinski K.; Broom M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

59,Universality in kinetic models of circadian rhythms in Arabidopsisthaliana,Biological evolution has endowed the plant Arabidopsis thaliana with genetically regulated circadian rhythms  A number of authors have published kinetic models for these oscillating chemical reactions based on a network of interacting genes  To investigate the hypothesis that the Arabidopsis circadian dynamical system is poised near a Hopf bifurcation like some other biological oscillators  we varied the kinetic parameters in the models and searched for bifurcations  Finding that each model does exhibit a supercritical Hopf bifurcation  we performed a weakly nonlinear analysis near the bifurcation points to derive the Stuart Landau amplitude equation  To illustrate a common dynamical structure  we scaled the numerical solutions to the models with the asymptotic solutions to the Stuart Landau equation to collapse the circadian oscillations onto two universal curves one for amplitude  and one for frequency  However  some models are close to bifurcation while others are far  some models are post bifurcation while others are pre bifurcation  and kinetic parameters that lead to a bifurcation in some models do not lead to a bifurcation in others  Future kinetic modeling can make use of our analysis to ensure models are consistent with each other and with the dynamics of the Arabidopsis circadian rhythm     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Xu Y.; Asadi-Zeydabadi M.; Tagg R.; Shindell O.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

63,Continuous-time stochastic processes for the spread of COVID-19 disease simulated via a Monte Carlo approach and comparison with deterministic models,Two stochastic models are proposed to describe the evolution of the COVID  9 pandemic  In the first model the population is partitioned into four compartments  susceptible S  infected I  removed R and dead people D  In order to have a cross validation  a deterministic version of such a model is also devised which is represented by a system of ordinary differential equations with delays  In the second stochastic model two further compartments are added  the class A of asymptomatic individuals and the class L of isolated infected people  Effects such as social distancing measures are easily included and the consequences are analyzed  Numerical solutions are obtained with Monte Carlo simulations  Quantitative predictions are provided which can be useful for the evaluation of political measures  e g  the obtained results suggest that strategies based on herd immunity are too risky  Finally  the models are calibrated on data referring to the second wave of infection in Italy     0    The Author s  ,Calleri F.; Nastasi G.; Romano V.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
64,Dimensionality reduction via path integration for computing mRNA distributions,Inherent stochasticity in gene expression leads to distributions of mRNA copy numbers in a population of identical cells  These distributions are determined primarily by the multitude of states of a gene promoter  each driving transcription at a different rate  In an era where single cell mRNA copy number data are more and more available  there is an increasing need for fast computations of mRNA distributions  In this paper  we present a method for computing separate distributions for each species of mRNA molecules  i e  mRNAs that have been either partially or fully processed post transcription  The method involves the integration over all possible realizations of promoter states  which we cast into a set of linear ordinary differential equations of dimension M  nj  where M is the number of available promoter states and nj is the mRNA copy number of species j up to which one wishes to compute the probability distribution  This approach is superior to solving the Master equation  ME  directly in two ways   a  the number of coupled differential equations in the ME approach is M                  L  where   j is the cutoff for the probability of the jth species of mRNA  and  b  the ME must be solved up to the cutoffs   j  which must be selected a priori  In our approach  the equation for the probability to observe n mRNAs of any species depends only on the the probability of observing n    mRNAs of that species  thus yielding a correct probability distribution up to an arbitrary n  To demonstrate the validity of our derivations  we compare our results with Gillespie simulations for ten randomly selected system parameters     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Albert J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

68,"Dynamic modeling of bone remodeling, osteolytic metastasis and PK/PD therapy: introducing variable order derivatives as a simplification technique",Bone is constantly being renewed  in the adult skeleton  bone resorption and formation are in a tightly coupled balance  allowing for a constant bone density to be maintained  Yet this micro environment provides the necessary conditions for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells  and thus bone is a common site for the development of metastases  mainly from primary breast and prostate cancer  Mathematical and computational models with differential equations can replicate this bone remodeling process  These models have been extended to include the effects of disruptive tumor pathologies in the bone dynamics  as metastases contribute to the decoupling between bone resorption and formation and to the self perpetuating tumor growth cycle  Such models may also contemplate the counteraction effects of currently used therapies  and  in the case of treatments with drugs  their pharmocokinetics and pharmacodynamics  We present a thorough overview of biochemical models for bone remodeling  in the presence of a tumour together with anti cancer and anti resorptive therapy  formulated as systems of first order differential equations  or simplified using variable order derivatives  The latter models  of which some are new to this paper  result in equations with fewer parameters  and allow accounting for anomalous diffusion processes  In this way  more compact and parsimonious models  that promptly highlight tumorous bone interactions  are achieved  providing an effective framework to counteract the loss of bone integrity on the affected areas     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Neto J.P.; Alho I.; Costa L.; Casimiro S.; Valério D.; Vinga S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
69,Evolutionary dynamics in an SI epidemic model with phenotype-structured susceptible compartment,We present an SI epidemic model whereby a continuous structuring variable captures variability in proliferative potential and resistance to infection among susceptible individuals  The occurrence of heritable  spontaneous changes in these phenotypic characteristics and the presence of a fitness trade off between resistance to infection and proliferative potential are explicitly incorporated into the model  The model comprises an ordinary differential equation for the number of infected individuals that is coupled with a partial integrodifferential equation for the population density function of susceptible individuals through an integral term  The expression for the basic reproduction number R is derived  the disease free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium of the model are characterised and a threshold theorem involving R is proved  Analytical results are integrated with the results of numerical simulations of a calibrated version of the model based on the results of artificial selection experiments in a host parasite system  The results of our mathematical study disentangle the impact of different evolutionary parameters on the spread of infectious diseases and the consequent phenotypic adaption of susceptible individuals  In particular  these results provide a theoretical basis for the observation that infectious diseases exerting stronger selective pressures on susceptible individuals and being characterised by higher infection rates are more likely to spread  Moreover  our results indicate that heritable  spontaneous phenotypic changes in proliferative potential and resistance to infection can either promote or prevent the spread of infectious diseases depending on the strength of selection acting on susceptible individuals prior to infection  Finally  we demonstrate that  when an endemic equilibrium is established  higher levels of resistance to infection and lower degrees of phenotypic heterogeneity among susceptible individuals are to be expected in the presence of infections which are characterised by lower rates of death and exert stronger selective pressures     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Lorenzi T.; Pugliese A.; Sensi M.; Zardini A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
70,Optimal control of an SIR epidemic through finite-time non-pharmaceutical intervention,We consider the problem of controlling an SIR model epidemic by temporarily reducing the rate of contact within a population  The control takes the form of a multiplicative reduction in the contact rate of infectious individuals  The control is allowed to be applied only over a finite time interval  while the objective is to minimize the total number of individuals infected in the long time limit  subject to some cost function for the control  We first consider the no cost scenario and analytically determine the optimal control and solution  We then study solutions when a cost of intervention is included  as well as a cost associated with overwhelming the available medical resources  Examples are studied through the numerical solution of the associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation  Finally  we provide some examples related directly to the current pandemic ,Ketcheson D.I.,Journal of mathematical biology
71,Threshold dynamics of a nonlocal and delayed cholera model in a spatially heterogeneous environment,A nonlocal and delayed cholera model with two transmission mechanisms in a spatially heterogeneous environment is derived  We introduce two basic reproduction numbers  one is for the bacterium in the environment and the other is for the cholera disease in the host population  If the basic reproduction number for the cholera bacterium in the environment is strictly less than one and the basic reproduction number of infection is no more than one  we prove globally asymptotically stability of the infection free steady state  Otherwise  the infection will persist and there exists at least one endemic steady state  For the special homogeneous case  the endemic steady state is actually unique and globally asymptotically stable  Under some conditions  the basic reproduction number of infection is strictly decreasing with respect to the diffusion coefficients of cholera bacteria and infectious hosts  When these conditions are violated  numerical simulation suggests that spatial diffusion may not only spread the infection from high risk region to low risk region  but also increase the infection level in high risk region     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Shu H.; Ma Z.; Wang X.-S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
72,Invasive behaviour under competition via a free boundary model: a numerical approach,What will happen when two invasive species are competing and invading the environment at the same time  In this paper  we try to find all the possible scenarios in such a situation based on the diffusive Lotka Volterra competition system with free boundaries  In a recent work  Du and Wu  Calc Var Partial Differ Equ             0    considered a weak strong competition case of this model  with spherical symmetry  and theoretically proved the existence of a  chase and run coexistence  phenomenon  for certain parameter ranges when the initial functions are chosen properly  Here we use a numerical approach to extend the theoretical research of Du and Wu  Calc Var Partial Differ Equ             0    in several directions  Firstly  we examine how the longtime dynamics of the model changes as the initial functions are varied  and the simulation results suggest that there are four possible longtime profiles of the dynamics  with the chase and run coexistence the only possible profile when both species invade successfully  Secondly  we show through numerical experiments that the basic features of the model appear to be retained when the environment is perturbed by periodic variation in time  Thirdly  our numerical analysis suggests that in two space dimensions the population range and the spatial population distribution of the successful invader tend to become more and more circular as time increases no matter what geometrical shape the initial population range possesses  Our numerical simulations cover the one space dimension case  and two space dimension case with or without spherical symmetry  The numerical methods here are based on that of Liu et al   Mathematics            0    Int J Comput Math  9      9 9 9 9   0 0   In the two space dimension case without radial symmetry  the level set method is used  while the front tracking method is used for the remaining cases  We hope the numerical observations in this paper can provide further insights to the biological invasion problem  and also to future theoretical investigations  More importantly  we hope the numerical analysis may reach more biologically oriented experts and inspire applications of some refined versions of the model tailored to specific real world biological invasion problems     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Khan K.; Liu S.; Schaerf T.M.; Du Y.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
73,Spectral analysis of transient amplifiers for death–birth updating constructed from regular graphs,A central question of evolutionary dynamics on graphs is whether or not a mutation introduced in a population of residents survives and eventually even spreads to the whole population  or becomes extinct  The outcome naturally depends on the fitness of the mutant and the rules by which mutants and residents may propagate on the network  but arguably the most determining factor is the network structure  Some structured networks are transient amplifiers  They increase for a certain fitness range the fixation probability of beneficial mutations as compared to a well mixed population  We study a perturbation method for identifying transient amplifiers for death birth updating  The method involves calculating the coalescence times of random walks on graphs and finding the vertex with the largest remeeting time  If the graph is perturbed by removing an edge from this vertex  there is a certain likelihood that the resulting perturbed graph is a transient amplifier  We test all pairwise nonisomorphic regular graphs up to a certain order and thus cover the whole structural range expressible by these graphs  For cubic and quartic regular graphs we find a sufficiently large number of transient amplifiers  For these networks we carry out a spectral analysis and show that the graphs from which transient amplifiers can be constructed share certain structural properties  Identifying spectral and structural properties may promote finding and designing such networks     0    The Author s  ,Richter H.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
74,Global stability of an age-structured population model on several temporally variable patches,We consider an age structured density dependent population model on several temporally variable patches  There are two key assumptions on which we base model setup and analysis  First  intraspecific competition is limited to competition between individuals of the same age  pure intra cohort competition  and it affects density dependent mortality  Second  dispersal between patches ensures that each patch can be reached from every other patch  directly or through several intermediary patches  within individual reproductive age  Using strong monotonicity we prove existence and uniqueness of solution and analyze its large time behavior in cases of constant  periodically variable and irregularly variable environment  In analogy to the next generation operator  we introduce the net reproductive operator and the basic reproduction number R for time independent and periodical models and establish the permanence dichotomy  if R      extinction on all patches is imminent  and if R      permanence on all patches is guaranteed  We show that a solution for the general time dependent problem can be bounded by above and below by solutions to the associated periodic problems  Using two side estimates  we establish uniform boundedness and uniform persistence of a solution for the general time dependent problem and describe its asymptotic behaviour     0    The Author s  ,Kozlov V.; Radosavljevic S.; Tkachev V.; Wennergren U.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
75,Dynamics of a new HIV model with the activation status of infected cells,The activation status can dictate the fate of an HIV infected CD + T cell  Infected cells with a low level of activation remain latent and do not produce virus  while cells with a higher level of activation are more productive and thus likely to transfer more virions to uninfected cells during cell to cell transmission  How the activation status of infected cells affects HIV dynamics under antiretroviral therapy remains unclear  We develop a new mathematical model that structures the population of infected cells continuously according to their activation status  The effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in blocking cell to cell viral transmission decreases as the level of activation of infected cells increases because the more virions are transferred from infected to uninfected cells during cell to cell transmission  the less effectively the treatment is able to inhibit the transmission  The basic reproduction number R of the model is shown to determine the existence and stability of the equilibria  Using the principal spectral theory and comparison principle  we show that the infection free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable when R is less than one  By constructing Lyapunov functional  we prove that the infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R is greater than one  Numerical investigation shows that even when treatment can completely block cell free virus infection  virus can still persist due to cell to cell transmission  The random switch between infected cells with different activation levels can also contribute to the replenishment of the latent reservoir  which is considered as a major barrier to viral eradication  This study provides a new modeling framework to study the observations  such as the low viral load persistence  extremely slow decay of latently infected cells and transient viral load measurements above the detection limit  in HIV infected patients during suppressive antiretroviral therapy     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Guo T.; Qiu Z.; Shen M.; Rong L.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

81,On the optimal control of SIR model with Erlang-distributed infectious period: isolation strategies,Mathematical models are formal and simplified representations of the knowledge related to a phenomenon  In classical epidemic models  a major simplification consists in assuming that the infectious period is exponentially distributed  then implying that the chance of recovery is independent on the time since infection  Here  we first attempt to investigate the consequences of relaxing this assumption on the performances of time variant disease control strategies by using optimal control theory  In the framework of a basic susceptible infected removed  SIR  model  an Erlang distribution of the infectious period is considered and optimal isolation strategies are searched for  The objective functional to be minimized takes into account the cost of the isolation efforts per time unit and the sanitary costs due to the incidence of the epidemic outbreak  Applying the Pontryagin s minimum principle  we prove that the optimal control problem admits only bang bang solutions with at most two switches  In particular  the optimal strategy could be postponing the starting intervention time with respect to the beginning of the outbreak  Finally  by means of numerical simulations  we show how the shape of the optimal solutions is affected by the different distributions of the infectious period  by the relative weight of the two cost components  and by the initial conditions     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Bolzoni L.; Della Marca R.; Groppi M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
82,Stability bounds of a delay visco-elastic rheological model with substrate friction,Cells and tissues exhibit sustained oscillatory deformations during remodelling  migration or embryogenesis  Although it has been shown that these oscillations correlate with intracellular biochemical signalling  the role of these oscillations is as yet unclear  and whether they may trigger drastic cell reorganisation events or instabilities remains unknown  Here  we present a rheological model that incorporates elastic  viscous and frictional components  and that is able to generate oscillatory response through a delay adaptive process of the rest length  We analyse its stability as a function of the model parameters and deduce analytical bounds of the stable domain  While increasing values of the delay and remodelling rate render the model unstable  we also show that increasing friction with the substrate destabilises the oscillatory response  This fact was unexpected and still needs to be verified experimentally  Furthermore  we numerically verify that the extension of the model with non linear deformation measures is able to generate sustained oscillations converging towards a limit cycle  We interpret this sustained regime in terms of non linear time varying stiffness parameters that alternate between stable and unstable regions of the linear model  We also note that this limit cycle is not present in the linear model  We study the phase diagram and the bifurcations of the non linear model  based on our conclusions on the linear one  Such dynamic analysis of the delay visco elastic model in the presence of friction is absent in the literature for both linear and non linear rheologies  Our work also shows how increasing values of some parameters such as delay and friction decrease its stability  while other parameters such as stiffness stabilise the oscillatory response     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Dawi M.A.; Muñoz J.J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
83,Long time behavior and stable patterns in high-dimensional polarity models of asymmetric cell division,Asymmetric cell division is one of the fundamental processes to create cell diversity in the early stage of embryonic development  During this process  the polarity formation in the cell membrane has been considered as a key process by which the entire polarity formation in the cytosol is controlled  and it has been extensively studied in both experiments and mathematical models  Nonetheless  a mathematically rigorous analysis of the polarity formation in the asymmetric cell division has been little explored  particularly for bulk surface models  In this article  we deal with polarity models proposed for describing the PAR polarity formation in the asymmetric cell division of a C  elegans embryo  Using a simpler but mathematically consistent model  we exhibit the long time behavior of the polarity formation of a bulk surface cell  Moreover  we mathematically prove the existence of stable polarity solutions of the model equation in an arbitrary high dimensional domain and analyse how the boundary position of polarity domain is determined  Our results propose that the existence and dynamics of the polarity in the asymmetric cell division can be understood universally in terms of basic mathematical structures     0    The Author s  ,Morita Y.; Seirin-Lee S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
84,Monostability and bistability of biological switches,Cell fate transition can be modeled by ordinary differential equations  ODEs  which describe the behavior of several molecules in interaction  and for which each stable equilibrium corresponds to a possible phenotype  or  biological trait    In this paper  we focus on simple ODE systems modeling two molecules which each negatively  or positively  regulate the other  It is well known that such models may lead to monostability or multistability  depending on the selected parameters  However  extensive numerical simulations have led systems biologists to conjecture that in the vast majority of cases  there cannot be more than two stable points  Our main result is a proof of this conjecture  More specifically  we provide a criterion ensuring at most bistability  which is indeed satisfied by most commonly used functions  This includes Hill functions  but also a wide family of convex and sigmoid functions  We also determine which parameters lead to monostability  and which lead to bistability  by developing a more general framework encompassing all our results     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Guilberteau J.; Pouchol C.; Pouradier Duteil N.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
85,Incorporating carbon dioxide into a stoichiometric producer–grazer model,Climate change models predict increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration  As ecosystems equilibrate with the atmosphere  stimulation of photosynthesis is expected to occur  However  growth limitation due to soil nutrients may potentially limit sequestration of carbon  Additionally  changes in producer nutritional quality may cause a decline in grazer populations  Here we extend the WKL model to allow for consideration of the impacts of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on producer grazer dynamics  We do so by explicitly tracking the free carbon in the medium and allowing the producer s growth rate to be limited by available carbon instead of light  This model is analyzed using primarily local bifurcation analysis  Overall  these analyses show that carbon sequestration due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide can be limited by insufficient available phosphorus  Furthermore  increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will cause decreased stoichiometric quality of producers where available phosphorus is limiting     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Davies C.M.; Wang H.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

88,Competitive coexistence of seasonal breeders,Many species are annual breeders who  between reproductive events  consume resources and may die  Their resource often reproduces continuously or has short  overlapping generations  An accurate model for such life cycles needs to represent both  the discrete  and the continuous time processes in the community  The dynamics of a single discrete breeder and its resource can differ significantly from that of a fully continuous consumer resource community  e g   Lotka Volterra  and that of a fully discrete one  e g   Nicholson Bailey   We study the dynamics of multiple discrete breeders on a single resource and identify a number of coexistence mechanisms and complex dynamics  The resource grows logistically  resource consumption is linear and consumer reproduction can be linear or nonlinear  We derive explicit conditions for the positive equilibrium state to exist and for mutual invasion to occur at that equilibrium  Stable equilibrium coexistence of more than one consumer is possible only when reproduction is nonlinear  Higher resource growth rate generally allows more consumers to stably coexist  Our explicit formulas allow us to generate communities of many coexisting consumers  Total biomass in the system seems to increase with the number of coexisting consumers  Complex patterns of coexistence arise  including bistability of equilibrium and non equilibrium coexistence  The mixed continuous discrete modeling approach can easily be adapted to study how certain aspects of global change affect discrete breeder communities     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Geng Y.; Lutscher F.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

91,Multiscale modeling of glioma pseudopalisades: contributions from the tumor microenvironment,Gliomas are primary brain tumors with a high invasive potential and infiltrative spread  Among them  glioblastoma multiforme  GBM  exhibits microvascular hyperplasia and pronounced necrosis triggered by hypoxia  Histological samples showing garland like hypercellular structures  so called pseudopalisades  centered around the occlusion site of a capillary are typical for GBM and hint on poor prognosis of patient survival  We propose a multiscale modeling approach in the kinetic theory of active particles framework and deduce by an upscaling process a reaction diffusion model with repellent pH taxis  We prove existence of a unique global bounded classical solution for a version of the obtained macroscopic system and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solution  Moreover  we study two different types of scaling and compare the behavior of the obtained macroscopic PDEs by way of simulations  These show that patterns  not necessarily of Turing type   including pseudopalisades  can be formed for some parameter ranges  in accordance with the tumor grade  This is true when the PDEs are obtained via parabolic scaling  undirected tissue   while no such patterns are observed for the PDEs arising by a hyperbolic limit  directed tissue   This suggests that brain tissue might be undirected   at least as far as glioma migration is concerned  We also investigate two different ways of including cell level descriptions of response to hypoxia and the way they are related     0    The Author s  ,Kumar P.; Li J.; Surulescu C.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
92,Exclusion and multiplicity for stable communities in Lotka–Volterra systems,For classic Lotka Volterra systems governing many interacting species  we establish an exclusion principle that rules out the existence of linearly asymptotically stable steady states in subcommunities of communities that admit a stable state which is internally D stable  This type of stability is known to be ensured  e g   by diagonal dominance or Volterra Lyapunov stability conditions  By consequence  the number of stable steady states of this type is bounded by Sperner s lemma on anti chains in a poset  The number of stable steady states can nevertheless be very large if there are many groups of species that strongly inhibit outsiders but have weak interactions among themselves  By examples we also show that in general it is possible for a stable community to contain a stable subcommunity consisting of a single species  Thus a recent empirical finding to the contrary  in a study of random competitive systems by Lischke and L ffler  Theor Popul Biol             0     does not hold without qualification     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Hong W.E.; Pego R.L.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

94,The impact of infection-derived immunity on disease dynamics,When modeling infectious diseases  it is common to assume that infection derived immunity is either     non existent or     perfect and lifelong  However there are many diseases in which infection derived immunity is known to be present but imperfect  There are various ways in which infection derived immunity can fail  which can ultimately impact the probability that an individual be reinfected by the same pathogen  as well as the long run population level prevalence of the pathogen  Here we discuss seven different models of imperfect infection derived immunity  including waning  leaky and all or nothing immunity  For each model we derive the probability that an infected individual becomes reinfected during their lifetime  given that the system is at endemic equilibrium  This can be thought of as the impact that each of these infection derived immunity failures have on reinfection  This measure is useful because it provides us with a way to compare different modes of failure of infection derived immunity     0    Crown ,Le A.; King A.A.; Magpantay F.M.G.; Mesbahi A.; Rohani P.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
95,Indirect identification of horizontal gene transfer,Several implicit methods to infer horizontal gene transfer  HGT  focus on pairs of genes that have diverged only after the divergence of the two species in which the genes reside  This situation defines the edge set of a graph  the later divergence time  LDT  graph  whose vertices correspond to genes colored by their species  We investigate these graphs in the setting of relaxed scenarios  i e   evolutionary scenarios that encompass all commonly used variants of duplication transfer loss scenarios in the literature  We characterize LDT graphs as a subclass of properly vertex colored cographs  and provide a polynomial time recognition algorithm as well as an algorithm to construct a relaxed scenario that explains a given LDT  An edge in an LDT graph implies that the two corresponding genes are separated by at least one HGT event  The converse is not true  however  We show that the complete xenology relation is described by an rs Fitch graph  i e   a complete multipartite graph satisfying constraints on the vertex coloring  This class of vertex colored graphs is also recognizable in polynomial time  We finally address the question  how much information about all HGT events is contained in LDT graphs  with the help of simulations of evolutionary scenarios with a wide range of duplication  loss  and HGT events  In particular  we show that a simple greedy graph editing scheme can be used to efficiently detect HGT events that are implicitly contained in LDT graphs     0    The Author s  ,Schaller D.; Lafond M.; Stadler P.F.; Wieseke N.; Hellmuth M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
96,Revisiting Shao and Sokal’s B2 index of phylogenetic balance,Measures of phylogenetic balance  such as the Colless and Sackin indices  play an important role in phylogenetics  Unfortunately  these indices are specifically designed for phylogenetic trees  and do not extend naturally to phylogenetic networks  which are increasingly used to describe reticulate evolution   This led us to consider a lesser known balance index  whose definition is based on a probabilistic interpretation that is equally applicable to trees and to networks  This index  known as the B  index  was first proposed by Shao and Sokal  Syst Zool  9               990   Surprisingly  it does not seem to have been studied mathematically since  Likewise  it is used only sporadically in the biological literature  where it tends to be viewed as arcane  In this paper  we study mathematical properties of B  such as its expectation and variance under the most common models of random trees and its extremal values over various classes of phylogenetic networks  We also assess its relevance in biological applications  and find it to be comparable to that of the Colless and Sackin indices  Altogether  our results call for a reevaluation of the status of this somewhat forgotten measure of phylogenetic balance     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Bienvenu F.; Cardona G.; Scornavacca C.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

100,Computing nearest neighbour interchange distances between ranked phylogenetic trees,Many popular algorithms for searching the space of leaf labelled  phylogenetic  trees are based on tree rearrangement operations  Under any such operation  the problem is reduced to searching a graph where vertices are trees and  undirected  edges are given by pairs of trees connected by one rearrangement operation  sometimes called a move   Most popular are the classical nearest neighbour interchange  subtree prune and regraft  and tree bisection and reconnection moves  The problem of computing distances  however  is NP hard in each of these graphs  making tree inference and comparison algorithms challenging to design in practice  Although anked phylogenetic trees are one of the central objects of interest in applications such as cancer research  immunology  and epidemiology  the computational complexity of the shortest path problem for these trees remained unsolved for decades  In this paper  we settle this problem for the ranked nearest neighbour interchange operation by establishing that the complexity depends on the weight difference between the two types of tree rearrangements  rank moves and edge moves   and varies from quadratic  which is the lowest possible complexity for this problem  to NP hard  which is the highest  In particular  our result provides the first example of a phylogenetic tree rearrangement operation for which shortest paths  and hence the distance  can be computed efficiently  Specifically  our algorithm scales to trees with tens of thousands of leaves  and likely hundreds of thousands if implemented efficiently      0    The Author s  ,Collienne L.; Gavryushkin A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

102,The consequences of switching strategies in a two-player iterated survival game,We consider two player iterated survival games in which players are able to switch from a more cooperative behavior to a less cooperative one at some step of an n step game  Payoffs are survival probabilities and lone individuals have to finish the game on their own  We explore the potential of these games to support cooperation  focusing on the case in which each single step is a Prisoner s Dilemma  We find that incentives for or against cooperation depend on the number of defections at the end of the game  as opposed to the number of steps in the game  Broadly  cooperation is supported when the survival prospects of lone individuals are relatively bleak  Specifically  we find three critical values or cutoffs for the loner survival probability which  in concert with other survival parameters  determine the incentives for or against cooperation  One cutoff determines the existence of an optimal number of defections against a fully cooperative partner  one determines whether additional defections eventually become disfavored as the number of defections by the partner increases  and one determines whether additional cooperations eventually become favored as the number of defections by the partner increases  We obtain expressions for these switch points and for optimal numbers of defections against partners with various strategies  These typically involve small numbers of defections even in very long games  We show that potentially long stretches of equilibria may exist  in which there is no incentive to defect more or cooperate more  We describe how individuals find equilibria in best response walks among n step strategies     0    The Author s  ,Salagnac O.; Wakeley J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

104,Quasi-steady-state reduction of a model for cytoplasmic transport of secretory vesicles in stimulated chromaffin cells,Neurosecretory cells spatially redistribute their pool of secretory vesicles upon stimulation  Recent observations suggest that in chromaffin cells vesicles move either freely or in a directed fashion by what appears to be a conveyor belt mechanism  We suggest that this observation reflects the transient active transport through molecular motors along cytoskeleton fibres and quantify this effect using a  D mathematical model that couples a diffusion equation to advection equations  In agreement with recent observations the model predicts that random motion dominates towards the cell centre whereas directed motion prevails in the region abutting the cortical membrane  Furthermore the model explains the observed bias of directed transport towards the periphery upon stimulation  Our model suggests that even if vesicle transport is indifferent with respect to direction  stimulation creates a gradient of free vesicles at first and this triggers the bias of transport in forward direction  Using matched asymptotic expansion we derive an approximate drift diffusion type model that is capable of quantifying this effect  Based on this model we compute the characteristic time for the system to adapt to stimulation and we identify a Michaelis Menten type law describing the flux of vesicles entering the pathway to exocytosis     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Oelz D.B.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

107,The rigid hybrid number for two phylogenetic trees,Recently there has been considerable interest in the problem of finding a phylogenetic network with a minimum number of reticulation vertices which displays a given set of phylogenetic trees  that is  a network with minimum hybrid number  Such networks are useful for representing the evolution of species whose genomes have undergone processes such as lateral gene transfer and recombination that cannot be represented appropriately by a phylogenetic tree  Even so  as was recently pointed out in the literature  insisting that a network displays the set of trees can be an overly restrictive assumption when modeling certain evolutionary phenomena such as incomplete lineage sorting  In this paper  we thus consider the less restrictive notion of rigidly displaying which we introduce and study here  More specifically  we characterize when two trees can be rigidly displayed by a certain type of phylogenetic network called a temporal tree child network in terms of fork picking sequences  These are sequences of special subconfigurations of the two trees related to the well studied cherry picking sequences  We also show that  in case it exists  the rigid hybrid number for two phylogenetic trees is given by a minimum weight fork picking sequence for the trees  Finally  we consider the relationship between the rigid hybrid number and three closely related numbers  the weak  beaded  and temporal hybrid numbers  In particular  we show that these numbers can all be different even for a fixed pair of trees  and also present an infinite family of pairs of trees which demonstrates that the difference between the rigid hybrid number and the temporal hybrid number for two phylogenetic trees on the same set of n leaves can grow at least linearly with n     0    The Author s  ,Huber K.T.; Linz S.; Moulton V.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

110,Time dependent asymptotic analysis of the gene regulatory network of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system in gram-negative bacteria,Efflux pumps are a mechanism of intrinsic and evolved resistance in bacteria  If an efflux pump can expel an antibiotic so that its concentration within the cell is below a killing threshold the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic  Efflux pumps may be specific or they may pump various different substances  This is why many efflux pumps confer multi drug resistance  MDR   In particular over expression of the AcrAB TolC efflux pump system confers MDR in both Salmonella and Escherichia coli  We consider the complex gene regulation network that controls expression of genes central to controlling the efflux associated genes acrAB and acrEF in Salmonella  We present the first mathematical model of this gene regulatory network in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations  Using a time dependent asymptotic analysis  we examine in detail the behaviour of the efflux system on various different timescales  Asymptotic approximations of the steady states provide an analytical comparison of targets for efflux inhibition     0    The Author s  ,Youlden G.H.; Ricci V.; Wang-Kan X.; Piddock L.J.V.; Jabbari S.; King J.R.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

113,Hybrid models of chemotaxis with application to leukocyte migration,Many chemical and biological systems involve reacting species with vastly different numbers of molecules agents  Hybrid simulations model such phenomena by combining discrete  e g   agent based  and continuous  e g   partial differential equation  or PDE based  descriptors of the dynamics of reactants with small and large numbers of molecules agents  respectively  We present a stochastic hybrid algorithm to model a stage of the immune response to inflammation  during which leukocytes reach a pathogen via chemotaxis  While large numbers of chemoattractant molecules justify the use of a PDE based model to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of its concentration  relatively small numbers of leukocytes and bacteria involved in the process undermine the veracity of their continuum treatment by masking the effects of stochasticity and have to be treated discretely  Motility and interactions between leukocytes and bacteria are modeled via random walk and a stochastic simulation algorithm  respectively  Since the latter assumes the reacting species to be well mixed  the discrete component of our hybrid algorithm deploys stochastic operator splitting  in which the sequence of the diffusion and reaction operations is determined autonomously during each simulation step  We conduct a series of numerical experiments to ascertain the accuracy and computational efficiency of our hybrid simulations and  then  to demonstrate the importance of randomness for predicting leukocyte migration and fate during the immune response to inflammation     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Lu H.; Um K.; Tartakovsky D.M.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
114,Stochastic nonlinear model for somatic cell population dynamics during ovarian follicle activation,In mammals  female germ cells are sheltered within somatic structures called ovarian follicles  which remain in a quiescent state until they get activated  all along reproductive life  We investigate the sequence of somatic cell events occurring just after follicle activation  starting by the awakening of precursor somatic cells  and their transformation into proliferative cells  We introduce a nonlinear stochastic model accounting for the joint dynamics of the two cell types  and allowing us to investigate the potential impact of a feedback from proliferative cells onto precursor cells  To tackle the key issue of whether cell proliferation is concomitant or posterior to cell awakening  we assess both the time needed for all precursor cells to awake  and the corresponding increase in the total cell number with respect to the initial cell number  Using the probabilistic theory of first passage times  we design a numerical scheme based on a rigorous finite state projection and coupling techniques to compute the mean extinction time and the cell number at extinction time  We find that the feedback term clearly lowers the number of proliferative cells at the extinction time  We calibrate the model parameters using an exact likelihood approach  We carry out a comprehensive comparison between the initial model and a series of submodels  which helps to select the critical cell events taking place during activation  and suggests that awakening is prominent over proliferation     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Clément F.; Robin F.; Yvinec R.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
115,Cooperative metabolic resource allocation in spatially-structured systems,Natural selection has shaped the evolution of cells and multi cellular organisms such that social cooperation can often be preferred over an individualistic approach to metabolic regulation  This paper extends a framework for dynamic metabolic resource allocation based on the maximum entropy principle to spatiotemporal models of metabolism with cooperation  Much like the maximum entropy principle encapsulates  bet hedging  behaviour displayed by organisms dealing with future uncertainty in a fluctuating environment  its cooperative extension describes how individuals adapt their metabolic resource allocation strategy to further accommodate limited knowledge about the welfare of others within a community  The resulting theory explains why local regulation of metabolic cross feeding can fulfil a community wide metabolic objective if individuals take into consideration an ensemble measure of total population performance as the only form of global information  The latter is likely supplied by quorum sensing in microbial systems or signalling molecules such as hormones in multi cellular eukaryotic organisms     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Tourigny D.S.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
116,A quasi-equilibrium reduced model of pancreatic insulin secretion,Much attention has been devoted in the last few decades to mathematical models of insulin secretion  in order to better understand the regulation of glycemia and its derangements  The glucose insulin homeostatic mechanism is so complex and gives rise to such diverse behavior following perturbations that different models had been published  which reproduced the results of single experiments  More recently  a unifying model of pancreatic insulin secretion was proposed  which is able to account  with a single value of the  meta parameters  for the wide array of clinically observed behavior  This model explicitly represented the pulsatile nature of the many pancreatic hormone secreting firing units  the price to pay for its flexibility and performance is the very high dimensionality  hundreds of thousand equations  of the corresponding dynamical system  Clearly  it would be desirable to reduce this model to a much simpler form while retaining its power to reproduce heterogeneous phenomena  The present work reviews the qualitative behavior of this pancreas pulsatile model and offers some insight into its reduction in equilibrium and quasi equilibrium conditions  also considering single shot  non repeated  glucose jumps from an approximately resting condition  such as would occur in standard Intra Venous bolus dosing of glucose during diabetes diagnostic maneuvers   The resulting quasi steady state model can be further endowed with additional lower order dynamics to also approximate transient behavior  Although a more accurate reduction of the original pulsatile model is left to further investigation  numerical results confirm the biomedical applicability of the formulation already obtained     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Borri A.; De Gaetano A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
117,A novel mathematical model of heterogeneous cell proliferation,We present a novel mathematical model of heterogeneous cell proliferation where the total population consists of a subpopulation of slow proliferating cells and a subpopulation of fast proliferating cells  The model incorporates two cellular processes  asymmetric cell division and induced switching between proliferative states  which are important determinants for the heterogeneity of a cell population  As motivation for our model we provide experimental data that illustrate the induced switching process  Our model consists of a system of two coupled delay differential equations with distributed time delays and the cell densities as functions of time  The distributed delays are bounded and allow for the choice of delay kernel  We analyse the model and prove the nonnegativity and boundedness of solutions  the existence and uniqueness of solutions  and the local stability characteristics of the equilibrium points  We find that the parameters for induced switching are bifurcation parameters and therefore determine the long term behaviour of the model  Numerical simulations illustrate and support the theoretical findings  and demonstrate the primary importance of transient dynamics for understanding the evolution of many experimental cell populations     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Vittadello S.T.; McCue S.W.; Gunasingh G.; Haass N.K.; Simpson M.J.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

122,Traveling waves for a three-component reaction–diffusion model of farmers and hunter-gatherers in the Neolithic transition,The Neolithic transition began the spread of early agriculture throughout Europe through interactions between farmers and hunter gatherers about  0 000 years ago  Archeological evidences indicate that the expanding velocity of farming into a region occupied by hunter gatherers is roughly constant all over Europe  In the late twentieth century  from the contribution of the radiocarbon dating  it could be found that there are two types of farmers  one is the original farmer and the other is the converted farmer which is genetically hunter gatherers but learned agriculture from neighbouring farmers  Then this raises the following questions  Which farming populations play a key role in the expansion of farmer populations in Europe  and what is the fate of hunter gatherers  e g   become extinct  or live in lower density  or live in agricultural life style   We consider a three component reaction diffusion system proposed by Aoki  Shida and Shigesada  which describes the interactions among the original farmers  the converted farmers  and the hunter gatherers  In order to resolve these two questions  we discuss traveling wave solutions which give the information of the expanding velocity of farmer populations  The main result is that two types of traveling wave solutions exist  depending on the growth rate of the original farmer population and the conversion rate of the hunter gatherer population to the converted farmer population  The profiles of traveling wave solutions indicate that the expansion of farmer populations is determined by the growth rate of the original farmer and the  maximal  carrying capacity of the converted farmer  and the fate of hunter gatherers is determined by the growth rate of the hunter gatherer and the conversion rate of the hunter gatherer to the converted farmer  Thus  our results provide a partial answer to the above two questions     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Fu S.-C.; Mimura M.; Tsai J.-C.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

124,Comparative analysis of continuum angiogenesis models,Although discrete approaches are increasingly employed to model biological phenomena  it remains unclear how complex  population level behaviours in such frameworks arise from the rules used to represent interactions between individuals  Discrete to continuum approaches  which are used to derive systems of coarse grained equations describing the mean field dynamics of a microscopic model  can provide insight into such emergent behaviour  Coarse grained models often contain nonlinear terms that depend on the microscopic rules of the discrete framework  however  and such nonlinearities can make a model difficult to mathematically analyse  By contrast  models developed using phenomenological approaches are typically easier to investigate but have a more obscure connection to the underlying microscopic system  To our knowledge  there has been little work done to compare solutions of phenomenological and coarse grained models  Here we address this problem in the context of angiogenesis  the creation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature   We compare asymptotic solutions of a classical  phenomenological  snail trail  model for angiogenesis to solutions of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations  PDEs  derived via a systematic coarse graining procedure  Pillay et al  in Phys Rev E 9     0    0   0    https   doi org  0   0  PhysRevE 9  0    0   For distinguished parameter regimes corresponding to chemotaxis dominated cell movement and low branching rates  both continuum models reduce at leading order to identical PDEs within the domain interior  Numerical and analytical results confirm that pointwise differences between solutions to the two continuum models are small if these conditions hold  and demonstrate how perturbation methods can be used to determine when a phenomenological model provides a good approximation to a more detailed coarse grained system for the same biological process     0    The Author s  ,Martinson W.D.; Ninomiya H.; Byrne H.M.; Maini P.K.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

136,Fixation probabilities in evolutionary dynamics under weak selection,In evolutionary dynamics  a key measure of a mutant trait s success is the probability that it takes over the population given some initial mutant appearance distribution  This  fixation probability  is difficult to compute in general  as it depends on the mutation s effect on the organism as well as the population s spatial structure  mating patterns  and other factors  In this study  we consider weak selection  which means that the mutation s effect on the organism is small  We obtain a weak selection perturbation expansion of a mutant s fixation probability  from an arbitrary initial configuration of mutant and resident types  Our results apply to a broad class of stochastic evolutionary models  in which the size and spatial structure are arbitrary  but fixed   The problem of whether selection favors a given trait is thereby reduced from exponential to polynomial complexity in the population size  when selection is weak  We conclude by applying these methods to obtain new results for evolutionary dynamics on graphs     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,McAvoy A.; Allen B.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

138,Dynamics of task allocation in social insect colonies: scaling effects of colony size versus work activities,The mechanisms through which work is organized are central to understanding how complex systems function  Previous studies suggest that task organization can emerge via nonlinear dynamical processes wherein individuals interact and modify their behavior through simple rules  However  there is very limited theory about how those processes are shaped by behavioral variation within social groups  In this work  we propose an adaptive modeling framework on task allocation by incorporating variation both in task performance and task related metabolic rates  We study the scaling effects of colony size on the resting probability as well as task allocation  We also numerically explore the effects of stochastic noise on task allocation in social insect colonies  Our theoretical and numerical results show that   a  changes in colony size can regulate the probability of colony resting and the allocation of tasks  and the direction of regulation depends on the nonlinear metabolic scaling effects of tasks   b  increased response thresholds may cause colonies to rest in varied patterns such as periodicity  In this case  we observed an interesting bubble phenomenon in the task allocation of social insect colonies for the first time   c  stochastic noise can cause work activities and task demand to fluctuate within a range  where the amplitude of the fluctuation is positively correlated with the intensity of noise     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH Germany  part of Springer Nature ,Feng T.; Charbonneau D.; Qiu Z.; Kang Y.,Journal of Mathematical Biology

141,The role of mode switching in a population of actin polymers with constraints,In this paper  we introduce a stochastic model for the dynamics of actin polymers and their interactions with other proteins in the cellular envelop  Each polymer elongates and shortens  and can switch between several modes depending on whether it is bound to accessory proteins that modulate its behaviour as  for example  elongation promoting factors  Our main aim is to understand the dynamics of a large population of polymers  assuming that the only limiting quantity is the total amount of monomers  set to be constant to some large N  We first focus on the evolution of a very long polymer  of size O N    with a rapid switch between modes  compared to the timescale over which the macroscopic fluctuations in the polymer size appear   Letting N tend to infinity  we obtain a fluid limit in which the effect of the switching appears only through the fraction of time spent in each mode at equilibrium  We show in particular that  in our situation where the number of monomers is limiting  a rapid binding unbinding dynamics may lead to an increased elongation rate compared to the case where the polymer is trapped in any of the modes  Next  we consider a large population of polymers and complexes  represented by a random measure on some appropriate type space  We show that as N tends to infinity  the stochastic system converges to a deterministic limit in which the switching appears as a flow between two categories of polymers  We exhibit some numerical examples in which the limiting behaviour of a single polymer differs from that of a population of competing  shorter  polymers for equivalent model parameters  Taken together  our results demonstrate that under conditions where the total number of monomers is limiting  the study of a single polymer is not sufficient to understand the behaviour of an ensemble of competing polymers     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Springer Verlag GmbH  DE part of Springer Nature ,Robin F.; Van Gorp A.; Véber A.,Journal of Mathematical Biology
142,Calcium Dynamics and Water Transport in Salivary Acinar Cells,Saliva is secreted from the acinar cells of the salivary glands  using mechanisms that are similar to other types of water transporting epithelial cells  Using a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques  over the past  0 years we have continually developed and modified a quantitative model of saliva secretion  and how it is controlled by the dynamics of intracellular calcium  However  over approximately the past   years there have been significant developments both in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and in the way these mechanisms should best be modelled  Here  we review the traditional understanding of how saliva is secreted  and describe how our work has suggested important modifications to this traditional view  We end with a brief description of the most recent data from living animals and discuss how this is now contributing to yet another iteration of model construction and experimental investigation     0    Society for Mathematical Biology ,Sneyd J.; Vera-Sigüenza E.; Rugis J.; Pages N.; Yule D.I.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
143,Microeconomics of Metabolism: The Warburg Effect as Giffen Behaviour,Metabolic behaviours of proliferating cells are often explained as a consequence of rational optimization of cellular growth rate  whereas microeconomics formulates consumption behaviours as optimization problems  Here  we pushed beyond the analogy to precisely map metabolism onto the theory of consumer choice  We thereby revealed the correspondence between long standing mysteries in both fields  the Warburg effect  a seemingly wasteful but ubiquitous strategy where cells favour aerobic glycolysis over more energetically efficient oxidative phosphorylation  and Giffen behaviour  the unexpected consumer behaviour where a good is demanded more as its price rises  We identified the minimal  universal requirements for the Warburg effect  a trade off between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis and complementarity  i e  impossibility of substitution for different metabolites  Thus  various hypotheses for the Warburg effect are integrated into an identical optimization problem with the same universal structure  Besides  the correspondence between the Warburg effect and Giffen behaviour implies that oxidative phosphorylation is counter intuitively stimulated when its efficiency is decreased by metabolic perturbations such as drug administration or mitochondrial dysfunction  the concept of Giffen behaviour bridges the Warburg effect and the reverse Warburg effect  This highlights that the application of microeconomics to metabolism can offer new predictions and paradigms for both biology and economics     0    The Author s  ,Yamagishi J.F.; Hatakeyama T.S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
144,Effects of Vector Maturation Time on the Dynamics of Cassava Mosaic Disease,Many plant diseases are caused by plant viruses that are often transmitted to plants by vectors  For instance  the cassava mosaic disease  which is spread by whiteflies  has a significant negative effect on plant growth and development  Since only mature whiteflies can contribute to the spread of the cassava mosaic virus  and the maturation time is non negligible compared to whitefly lifetime  it is important to consider the effects this maturation time can have on the dynamics  In this paper  we propose a mathematical model for dynamics of cassava mosaic disease that includes immature and mature vectors and explicitly includes a time delay representing vector maturation time  A special feature of our plant epidemic model is that vector recruitment is negatively related to the delayed ratio between vector density and plant density  We identify conditions of biological feasibility and stability of different steady states in terms of system parameters and the time delay  Numerical stability analyses and simulations are performed to explore the role of various parameters  and to illustrate the behaviour of the model in different dynamical regimes  We show that the maturation delay may stabilise epidemiological dynamics that would otherwise be cyclic     0    The Author s  ,Al Basir F.; Kyrychko Y.N.; Blyuss K.B.; Ray S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
145,A Zika Endemic Model for the Contribution of Multiple Transmission Routes,Zika virus disease is a viral disease primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female mosquitoes  Recent evidence indicates that the virus can also be sexually transmitted in hosts and vertically transmitted in vectors  In this paper  we propose a Zika model with three transmission routes  that is  vector borne transmission between humans and mosquitoes  sexual transmission within humans and vertical transmission within mosquitoes  The basic reproduction number R is computed and shown to be a sharp threshold quantity  Namely  the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R      whereas there exists a unique endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable as R     The relative contributions of each transmission route on the reproduction number  and the short  and long term host infections are analyzed  Numerical simulations confirm that vectorial transmission contributes the most to the initial and subsequent transmission  The role of sexual transmission in the early phase of a Zika outbreak is greater than the long term  while vertical transmission is the opposite  Reducing mosquito bites is the most effective measure in lowering the risk of Zika virus infection     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Yuan X.; Lou Y.; He D.; Wang J.; Gao D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
146,Mathematical Model for Delayed Responses in Immune Checkpoint Blockades,We introduce a set of ordinary differential equations  ODEs  that qualitatively reproduce delayed responses observed in immune checkpoint blockade therapy  e g  anti CTLA   ipilimumab   This type of immunotherapy has been at the forefront of novel and promising cancer treatments over the past decade and was recognised by the  0   Nobel Prize in Medicine  Our model describes the competition between effector T cells and non effector T cells in a tumour  By calibrating a small subset of parameters that control immune checkpoint expression along with the patient s immune system cancer readiness  our model is able to simulate either a complete absence of patient response to treatment  a quick anti tumour T cell response  within days  or a delayed response  within months   Notably  the parameter space that generates a delayed response is thin and must be carefully calibrated  reflecting the observation that a small subset of patients experience such reactions to checkpoint blockade therapies  Finally  simulations predict that the anti tumour T cell storm that breaks the delay is very short lived compared to the length of time the cancer is able to stay suppressed  This suggests the tumour may subsist off an environment hostile to effector T cells  however  these cells are at rare times able to break through the tumour immunosuppressive defences to neutralise the tumour for a prolonged period  Our simulations aim to qualitatively describe the delayed response phenomenon without making precise fits to particular datasets  which are limited  It is our hope that our foundational model will stimulate further interest within the immunology modelling field     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Zheng C.Y.; Kim P.S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
147,Modelling Immune Memory Development,The cellular adaptive immune response to influenza has been analyzed through several recent mathematical models  In particular  Zarnitsyna et al   Front Immunol     9   0    show how central memory CD + T cells reach a plateau after repeated infections  and analyze their role in the immune response to further challenges  In this paper  we further investigate the theoretical features of that model by extracting from the infection dynamics a discrete map that describes the build up of memory cells  Furthermore  we show how the model by Zarnitsyna et al   Front Immunol     9   0    can be viewed as a fast scale approximation of a model allowing for recruitment of target epithelial cells  Finally  we analyze which components of the model are essential to understand the progressive build up of immune memory  This is performed through the analysis of simplified versions of the model that include some components only of immune response  The analysis performed may also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which two dose vaccination strategies can be helpful     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Pascucci E.; Pugliese A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
148,The Signature of Endemic Populations in the Spread of Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks,The mountain pine beetle  MPB  is among the most destructive eruptive forest pests in North America  A recent increase in the frequency and severity of outbreaks  combined with an eastward range expansion towards untouched boreal pine forests  has spurred a great interest by government  industry and academia into the population ecology of this tree killing bark beetle  Modern approaches to studying the spread of the MPB often involve the analysis of large scale  high resolution datasets on landscape level damage to pine forests  This creates a need for new modelling tools to handle the unique challenges associated with large sample sizes and spatial effects  In two companion papers  Koch et al  in Environ Ecol Stat  https   doi org  0  00  s 0    0 0 00        0 0a  J R Soc Interface      0   0 00      0 0b   we explain how the computational challenges of dispersal and spatial autocorrelation can be addressed using separable kernels  In this paper  we use these ideas to capture nonstationary patterns in the dispersal flights of MPB  This facilitates a landscape level inference of subtle properties of MPB attack behaviour based on aerial surveys of killed pine  Using this model  we estimate the size of the cryptic endemic MPB population  which formerly has been measurable only by means of costly and time intensive ground surveys     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Koch D.; Lewis M.A.; Lele S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
149,Modeling Microglia Activation and Inflammation-Based Neuroprotectant Strategies During Ischemic Stroke,Neural inflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke  During this process  microglial cells can be activated into two different phenotypes  the M  phenotype  which can worsen brain injury by producing pro inflammatory cytokines  or the M  phenotype  which can aid in long term recovery by producing anti inflammatory cytokines  In this study  we formulate a nonlinear system of differential equations to model the activation of microglia post ischemic stroke  which includes bidirectional switching between the microglia phenotypes  as well as the interactions between these cells and the cytokines that they produce  Further  we explore neuroprotectant based modeling strategies to suppress the activation of the detrimental M  phenotype  while promoting activation of the beneficial M  phenotype  Through use of global sensitivity techniques  we analyze the effects of the model parameters on the ratio of M  to M  microglia and the total number of activated microglial cells in the system over time  Results demonstrate the significance of bidirectional microglia phenotype switching on the ratio of M  to M  microglia  in both the absence and presence of neuroprotectant terms  Simulations further suggest that early inhibition of M  activation and support of M  activation leads to a decreased minimum ratio of M  to M  microglia and allows for a larger number of M  than M  cells for a longer time period     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Amato S.; Arnold A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
150,A Random Walk Approach to Transport in Tissues and Complex Media: From Microscale Descriptions to Macroscale Models,The biological processes necessary for the development and continued survival of any organism are often strongly influenced by the transport properties of various biologically active species  The transport phenomena involved vary over multiple temporal and spatial scales  from organism level behaviors such as the search for food  to systemic processes such as the transport of oxygen from the lungs to distant organs  down to microscopic phenomena such as the stochastic movement of proteins in a cell  Each of these processes is influenced by many interrelated factors  Identifying which factors are the most important  and how they interact to determine the overall result is a problem of great importance and interest  Experimental observations are often fit to relatively simple models  but in reality the observations are the output of complicated functions of the physicochemical  topological  and geometrical properties of a given system  Herein we use multistate continuous time random walks and generalized master equations to model transport processes involving spatial jumps  immobilization at defined sites  and stochastic internal state changes  The underlying spatial models  which are framed as graphs  may have different classes of nodes  and walkers may have internal states that are governed by a Markov process  A general form of the solutions  using Fourier Laplace transforms and asymptotic analysis  is developed for several spatially infinite regular lattices in one and two spatial dimensions  and the theory is developed for the analysis of transport and internal state changes on general graphs  The goal in each case is to shed light on how experimentally observable macroscale transport coefficients can be explained in terms of microscale properties of the underlying processes  This work is motivated by problems arising in transport in biological tissues  but the results are applicable to a broad class of problems that arise in other applications     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Stotsky J.A.; Gou J.; Othmer H.G.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
151,Invading and Receding Sharp-Fronted Travelling Waves,Biological invasion  whereby populations of motile and proliferative individuals lead to moving fronts that invade vacant regions  is routinely studied using partial differential equation models based upon the classical Fisher KPP equation  While the Fisher KPP model and extensions have been successfully used to model a range of invasive phenomena  including ecological and cellular invasion  an often overlooked limitation of the Fisher KPP model is that it cannot be used to model biological recession where the spatial extent of the population decreases with time  In this work  we study the Fisher Stefan model  which is a generalisation of the Fisher KPP model obtained by reformulating the Fisher KPP model as a moving boundary problem  The nondimensional Fisher Stefan model involves just one parameter     which relates the shape of the density front at the moving boundary to the speed of the associated travelling wave  c  Using numerical simulation  phase plane and perturbation analysis  we construct approximate solutions of the Fisher Stefan model for both slowly invading and receding travelling waves  as well as for rapidly receding travelling waves  These approximations allow us to determine the relationship between c and   so that commonly reported experimental estimates of c can be used to provide estimates of the unknown parameter    Interestingly  when we reinterpret the Fisher KPP model as a moving boundary problem  many overlooked features of the classical Fisher KPP phase plane take on a new interpretation since travelling waves solutions with c    are normally disregarded  This means that our analysis of the Fisher Stefan model has both practical value and an inherent mathematical value     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,El-Hachem M.; McCue S.W.; Simpson M.J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

153,Mathematical Modeling of Dynamic Cellular Association Patterns in Seminiferous Tubules,In vertebrates  sperm is generated in testicular tube like structures called seminiferous tubules  The differentiation stages of spermatogenesis exhibit a dynamic spatiotemporal wavetrain pattern  There are two types of pattern the vertical type  which is observed in mice  and the helical type  which is observed in humans  The mechanisms of this pattern difference remain little understood  In the present study  we used a three species reaction diffusion model to reproduce the wavetrain pattern observed in vivo  We hypothesized that the wavelength of the pattern in mice was larger than that in humans and undertook numerical simulations  We found complex patterns of helical and vertical pattern frequency  which can be understood by pattern selection using boundary conditions  From these theoretical results  we predicted that a small number of vertical patterns should be present in human seminiferous tubules  We then found vertical patterns in histological sections of human tubules  consistent with the theoretical prediction  Finally  we showed that the previously reported irregularity of the human pattern could be reproduced using two factors  a wider unstable wavenumber range and the irregular geometry of human compared with mouse seminiferous tubules  These results show that mathematical modeling is useful for understanding the pattern dynamics of seminiferous tubules in vivo     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Kawamura M.; Sugihara K.; Takigawa-Imamura H.; Ogawa T.; Miura T.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

155,The Effect of Harvesting Adults on the Evolution of Reproduction Age Via Density-Dependent Juvenile Mortality,In this paper  we used a generic two stage population model to derive an adaptive dynamical system for the evolution of reproduction age and studied how this evolution is driven by the harvest of adults  We considered the tradeoffs between maturation rate and fecundity  juvenile mortality  and adult mortality  We analyzed the benefit and cost of faster maturation under each tradeoff that drives the evolution  We found that harvesting adults affects the evolution of maturation by affecting the benefit  For the tradeoff between maturation and juvenile mortality  harvesting adults does not affect the benefit and thus  does not affect optimal maturation strategy  For the other two tradeoffs  harvesting adults affects the benefit through the equilibrium adult juvenile ratio  which is determined by the density dependence of juveniles  Harvesting adults causes a slower maturation only if it significantly reduces this ratio  which can only happen with very strong adult protection to juveniles  Otherwise  harvesting adults always causes a faster maturation     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Xue S.; Li M.; Ma J.; Li J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
156,Pattern Formation in a Three-Species Cyclic Competition Model,In nature  different species compete among themselves for common resources and favorable habitat  Therefore  it becomes really important to determine the key factors in maintaining the bio diversity  Also  some competing species follow cyclic competition in real world where the competitive dominance is characterized by a cyclic ordering  In this paper  we study the formation of a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns including stationary  periodic  quasi periodic and chaotic population distributions for a diffusive Lotka Volterra type three species cyclic competition model with two different types of cyclic ordering  For both types of cyclic ordering  the temporal dynamics of the corresponding non spatial system show the extinction of two species through global bifurcations such as homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations  For the spatial system  we show that the existence of Turing patterns is possible for a particular cyclic ordering  while it is not the case for the other cyclic ordering through both the analytical and numerical methods  Further  we illustrate an interesting scenario of short range invasion as opposed to the usual invasion phenomenon over the entire habitat  Also  our study reveals that both the stationary and dynamic population distributions can coexist in different parts of a habitat  Finally  we extend the spatial system by incorporating nonlocal intra specific competition terms for all the three competing species  Our study shows that the introduction of nonlocality in intra specific competitions stabilizes the system dynamics by transforming a dynamic population distribution to stationary  Surprisingly  this nonlocality induced stationary pattern formation leads to the extinction of one species and hence  gives rise to the loss of bio diversity for intermediate ranges of nonlocality  However  the bio diversity can be restored for sufficiently large extent of nonlocality     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Manna K.; Volpert V.; Banerjee M.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

163,The Effect of Covert and Overt Infections on Disease Dynamics in Honey-Bee Colonies,Viral diseases of honey bees are important economically and ecologically and have been widely modelled  The models reflect the fact that  in contrast to the typical case for vertebrates  invertebrates cannot acquire immunity to a viral disease  so they are of SIS or  more often  SI type  Very often  these diseases may be transmitted vertically as well as horizontally  by vectors as well as directly  and through the environment  although models do not generally reflect all these transmission mechanisms  Here  we shall consider an important additional complication the consequences of which have yet to be fully explored in a model  namely that both infected honey bees and their vectors may best be described using more than one infection class  For honey bees  we consider three infection classes  Covert infections occur when bees have the virus under control  such that they do not display symptoms of the disease  and are minimally or not at all affected by it  Acutely overtly infected bees often exhibit severe symptoms and have a greatly curtailed lifespan  Chronically overtly infected bees typically have milder symptoms and a moderately shortened lifespan  For the vector  we consider just two infection classes which are covert infected and overt infected as has been observed in deformed wing virus  DWV  vectored by varroa mites  Using this structure  we explore the impact of spontaneous transition of both mites and bees from a covertly to an overtly infected state  which is also a novel element in modelling viral diseases of honey bees made possible by including the different infected classes  The dynamics of these diseases are unsurprisingly rather different from the dynamics of a standard SI or SIS disease  In this paper  we highlight how our compartmental structure for infection in honey bees and their vectors impact the disease dynamics observed  concentrating in particular on DWV vectored by varroa mites  If there is no spontaneous transition  then a basic reproduction number R exists  We derive a condition for R    that reflects the complexities of the system  with components for vertical and for direct and vector mediated horizontal transmission  using the directed graph of the next generation matrix of the system  Such a condition has never previously been derived for a honey bee mite virus system  When spontaneous transitions do occur  then R no longer exists  but we introduce a modification of the analysis that allows us to determine whether  i  the disease remains largely covert or  ii  a substantial outbreak of overt disease occurs     0    The Author s  ,Britton N.F.; Jane White K.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
164,Dynamics of Competitive Systems with Diffusion Between Source–Sink Patches,This paper considers two species competitive systems with one species  diffusion between patches  Each species can persist alone in the corresponding patch  a source   while the mobile species cannot survive in the other  a sink   Using the method of monotone dynamical systems  we give a rigorous analysis on persistence of the system  prove local global stability of the equilibria and show new types of bi stability  These results demonstrate that diffusion could lead to results reversing those without diffusion  which extend the principle of competitive exclusion  Diffusion could lead to persistence of the mobile competitor in the sink  make it reach total abundance larger than if non diffusing and even exclude the opponent  The total abundance is shown to be a distorted function  surface  of diffusion rates  which extends both previous theory and experimental observations  A novel strategy of diffusion is deduced in which the mobile competitor could drive the opponent into extinction  and then approach the maximal abundance  Initial population density and diffusive asymmetry play a role in the competition  Our work has potential applications in biodiversity conservation and economic competition     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Wu H.; Wang Y.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
165,Patient-Specific Modelling of Blood Coagulation,Blood coagulation represents one of the most studied processes in biomedical modelling  However  clinical applications of this modelling remain limited because of the complexity of this process and because of large inter patient variation of the concentrations of blood factors  kinetic constants and physiological conditions  Determination of some of these patients specific parameters is experimentally possible  but it would be related to excessive time and material costs impossible in clinical practice  We propose in this work a methodological approach to patient specific modelling of blood coagulation  It begins with conventional thrombin generation tests allowing the determination of parameters of a reduced kinetic model  Next  this model is used to study spatial distributions of blood factors and blood coagulation in flow  and to evaluate the results of medical treatment of blood coagulation disorders     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Ratto N.; Bouchnita A.; Chelle P.; Marion M.; Panteleev M.; Nechipurenko D.; Tardy-Poncet B.; Volpert V.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
166,Stability Analysis of a Signaling Circuit with Dual Species of GTPase Switches,GTPases are molecular switches that regulate a wide range of cellular processes  such as organelle biogenesis  position  shape  function  vesicular transport between organelles  and signal transduction  These hydrolase enzymes operate by toggling between an active   ON   guanosine triphosphate  GTP  bound state and an inactive   OFF   guanosine diphosphate  GDP  bound state  such a toggle is regulated by GEFs  guanine nucleotide exchange factors  and GAPs  GTPase activating proteins   Here we propose a model for a network motif between monomeric  m  and trimeric  t  GTPases assembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms  We develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two classes of GTPases are interlinked conditional to their ON OFF states within a motif through coupling and feedback loops  We provide explicit formulae for the steady states of the system and perform classical local stability analysis to systematically investigate the role of the different connections between the GTPase switches  Interestingly  a coupling of the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to provide two locally stable states  one where both active inactive forms of the mGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where both m  and tGTPase have high concentrations  Moreover  when a feedback loop from the GEF of the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the coupled system  two other locally stable states emerged  In both states the tGTPase is inactivated and active tGTPase concentrations are low  Finally  the addition of a second feedback loop  from the active tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase  gives rise to a family of steady states that can be parametrized by a range of inactive tGTPase concentrations  Our findings reveal that the coupling of these two different GTPase motifs can dramatically change their steady state behaviors and shed light on how such coupling may impact signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cells     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Stolerman L.M.; Ghosh P.; Rangamani P.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
167,Natural Killer Cells Recruitment in Oncolytic Virotherapy: A Mathematical Model,In this paper  we investigate how natural killer  NK  cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment  TME  affects oncolytic virotherapy  NK cells play a major role against viral infections  They are  however  known to induce early viral clearance of oncolytic viruses  which hinders the overall efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy  Here  we formulate and analyze a simple mathematical model of the dynamics of the tumor  OV and NK cells using currently available preclinical information  The aim of this study is to characterize conditions under which the synergistic balance between OV induced NK responses and required viral cytopathicity may or may not result in a successful treatment  In this study  we found that NK cell recruitment to the TME must take place neither too early nor too late in the course of OV infection so that treatment will be successful  NK cell responses are most influential at either early  partly because of rapid response of NK cells to viral infections or antigens  or later  partly because of antitumoral ability of NK cells  stages of oncolytic virotherapy  The model also predicts that   a  an NK cell response augments oncolytic virotherapy only if viral cytopathicity is weak   b  the recruitment of NK cells modulates tumor growth  and  c  the depletion of activated NK cells within the TME enhances the probability of tumor escape in oncolytic virotherapy  Taken together  our model results demonstrate that OV infection is crucial  not just to cytoreduce tumor burden  but also to induce the stronger NK cell response necessary to achieve complete or at least partial tumor remission  Furthermore  our modeling framework supports combination therapies involving NK cells and OV which are currently used in oncolytic immunovirotherapy to treat several cancer types     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Senekal N.S.; Mahasa K.J.; Eladdadi A.; de Pillis L.; Ouifki R.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
168,Electrodiffusion with Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels in Dendritic Spine,We investigate calcium signaling feedback through calcium activated potassium channels of a dendritic spine by applying the immersed boundary method with electrodiffusion  We simulate the stochastic gating of such ion channels and the resulting spatial distribution of concentration  current  and membrane voltage within the dendritic spine  In this simulation  the permeability to ionic flow across the membrane is regulated by the amplitude of chemical potential barriers  With spatially localized ion channels  chemical potential barriers are locally and stochastically regulated  This regulation represents the ion channel gating with multiple subunits  the open and closed states governed by a continuous time Markov process  The model simulation recapitulates an inhibitory action on voltage sensitive calcium channels by the calcium activated potassium channels in a stochastic manner as a non local feedback loop  The model predicts amplified calcium influx with more closely placed channel complexes  proposing a potential mechanism of differential calcium handling by channel distributions  This work provides a foundation for future computer simulation studies of dendritic spine motility and structural plasticity     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Lee P.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
169,Multiscale Modeling of Uranium Bioreduction in Porous Media by One-Dimensional Biofilms,We formulate a multiscale mathematical model that describes the bioreduction of uranium in porous media  On the mesoscale we describe the bioreduction of uranium  VI  to uranium  IV  using a multispecies one dimensional biofilm model with suspended bacteria and thermodynamic growth inhibition  We upscale the mesoscopic  colony scale  model to the macroscale  reactor scale  and investigate the behavior of substrate utilization and production  attachment and detachment processes  and thermodynamic effects not usually considered in biofilm growth models  Simulation results of the reactor model indicate that thermodynamic inhibition quantitatively alters the dynamics of the model and neglecting thermodynamic effects may over  or underestimate chemical concentrations in the system  Furthermore  we numerically investigate uncertainties related to the specific choice of attachment and detachment rate coefficients and find that while increasing the attachment rate coefficient or decreasing the detachment rate coefficient leads to thicker biofilms  performance of the reactor remains largely unaffected     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Gaebler H.J.; Eberl H.J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
170,Bespoke Turing Systems,Reaction diffusion systems are an intensively studied form of partial differential equation  frequently used to produce spatially heterogeneous patterned states from homogeneous symmetry breaking via the Turing instability  Although there are many prototypical  Turing systems  available  determining their parameters  functional forms  and general appropriateness for a given application is often difficult  Here  we consider the reverse problem  Namely  suppose we know the parameter region associated with the reaction kinetics in which patterning is required we present a constructive framework for identifying systems that will exhibit the Turing instability within this region  whilst in addition often allowing selection of desired patterning features  such as spots  or stripes  In particular  we show how to build a system of two populations governed by polynomial morphogen kinetics such that the  patterning parameter domain  in any spatial dimension   morphogen phases  in any spatial dimension   and even type of resulting pattern  in up to two spatial dimensions  can all be determined  Finally  by employing spatial and temporal heterogeneity  we demonstrate that mixed mode patterns  spots  stripes  and complex prepatterns  are also possible  allowing one to build arbitrarily complicated patterning landscapes  Such a framework can be employed pedagogically  or in a variety of contemporary applications in designing synthetic chemical and biological patterning systems  We also discuss the implications that this freedom of design has on using reaction diffusion systems in biological modelling and suggest that stronger constraints are needed when linking theory and experiment  as many simple patterns can be easily generated given freedom to choose reaction kinetics     0    The Author s  ,Woolley T.E.; Krause A.L.; Gaffney E.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
171,Alternative Strategies for the Estimation of a Disease’s Basic Reproduction Number: A Model-Agnostic Study,This work presents a model agnostic evaluation of four different models that estimate a disease s basic reproduction number  The evaluation presented is twofold  first  the theory behind each of the models is reviewed and compared  then  each model is tested with eight impartial simulations  All scenarios were constructed in an experimental framework that allows each model to fulfill its assumptions and hence  obtain unbiased results for each case  Among these models is the one proposed by Thompson et al   Epidemics  9  00      0 9   i e   a Bayesian estimation method well established in epidemiological practice  The other three models include a novel state space method and two simulation based approaches based on a Poisson infection process  The advantages and flaws of each model are discussed from both theoretical and practical standpoints  Finally  we present the evolution of Covid  9 outbreak in Colombia as a case study for computing the basic reproduction number with each one of the reviewed methods     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Páez G.N.; Cerón J.F.; Cortés S.; Quiroz A.J.; Zea J.F.; Franco C.; Cruz É.; Vargas G.; Castañeda C.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
172,Parameter Estimation in a PDE Model for the Spatial Spread of Cocoa Black Pod Disease,In this paper  we develop an epidemiological model with both environmental  primary infection from the environmental spores reservoir  and direct transmission  secondary infection from an infected host to a susceptible pod   This model simulates the spatiotemporal evolution of cocoa black pod disease caused by Phytophthora megakarya  Since reliable parameter estimation is a central issue for modeling realistic biological systems  we used a mechanistic statistical approach to estimate model parameters from real observations of a specific cocoa plot  In addition  to refine numerical simulations of the pathosystem  data describing the shade intensity all over the plot were exploited and led to increased model predictions accuracy and also highlighted a higher number of infected pods located in areas of the plot with higher shading intensity  Recommendations in terms of promoting cocoa farming in systems with low shading intensity may be evident if these results are confirmed  Our results also highlight the importance of the environmental spore reservoir in black pod disease dynamics     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Nembot Fomba C.G.; ten Hoopen G.M.; Soubeyrand S.; Roques L.; Ambang Z.; Takam Soh P.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
173,Three-patch Models for the Evolution of Dispersal in Advective Environments: Varying Drift and Network Topology,We study the evolution of dispersal in advective three patch models with distinct network topologies  Organisms can move between connected patches freely and they are also subject to the passive  directed drift  The carrying capacity is assumed to be the same in all patches  while the drift rates could vary  We first show that if all drift rates are the same  the faster dispersal rate is selected for all three models  For general drift rates  we show that the infinite diffusion rate is a local Convergence Stable Strategy  CvSS  for all three models  However  there are notable differences for three models  For Model I  the faster dispersal is always favored  irrespective of the drift rates  and thus the infinity dispersal rate is a global CvSS  In contrast  for Models II and III a singular strategy will exist for some ranges of drift rates and bi stability phenomenon happens  i e   both infinity and zero diffusion rates are local CvSSs  Furthermore  for both Models II and III  it is possible for two competing populations to coexist by varying drift and diffusion rates  Some predictions on the dynamics of n patch models in advective environments are given along with some numerical evidence     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Jiang H.; Lam K.-Y.; Lou Y.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
174,Multiscale Modelling of De Novo Anaerobic Granulation,A multiscale mathematical model is presented to describe de novo granulation  and the evolution of multispecies granular biofilms  in a continuously fed bioreactor  The granule is modelled as a spherical free boundary domain with radial symmetry  The equation governing the free boundary is derived from global mass balance considerations and takes into account the growth of sessile biomass as well as exchange fluxes with the bulk liquid  Starting from a vanishing initial value  the expansion of the free boundary is initiated by the attachment process  which depends on the microbial species concentrations within the bulk liquid and their specific attachment velocity  Nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs model the growth of the sessile microbial species  while quasi linear parabolic PDEs govern the dynamics of substrates and invading species within the granular biofilm  Nonlinear ODEs govern the evolution of soluble substrates and planktonic biomass within the bulk liquid  The model is applied to an anaerobic  granular based bioreactor system  and solved numerically to test its qualitative behaviour and explore the main aspects of de novo anaerobic granulation  ecology  biomass distribution  relative abundance  dimensional evolution of the granules and soluble substrates  and planktonic biomass dynamics within the bioreactor  The numerical results confirm that the model accurately describes the ecology and the concentrically layered structure of anaerobic granules observed experimentally  and that it can predict the effects on the process of significant factors  such as influent wastewater composition  granulation properties of planktonic biomass  biomass density  detachment intensity  and number of granules     0    The Author s  ,Tenore A.; Russo F.; Mattei M.R.; D’Acunto B.; Collins G.; Frunzo L.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
175,Dimension Estimate of Uniform Attractor for a Model of High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound-Induced Thermotherapy,High intensity focussed ultrasound  HIFU  has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality  for the treatment of various cancers  that is gaining significant traction in clinical oncology  It is a cancer therapy that avoids many of the associated negative side effects of other more well established therapies  such as surgery  chemotherapy and radiotherapy  and does not lead to the longer recuperation times necessary in these cases  The increasing interest in HIFU from biomedical researchers and clinicians has led to the development of a number of mathematical models to capture the effects of HIFU energy deposition in biological tissue  In this paper  we study the simplest such model that has been utilized by researchers to study temperature evolution under HIFU therapy  Although the model poses significant theoretical challenges  in earlier work  we were able to establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system of PDEs  see Efendiev et al  Adv Appl Math Sci  9              0 0   In the current work  we take the next natural step of studying the long time dynamics of solutions to this model  in the case where the external forcing is quasi periodic  In this case  we are able to prove the existence of uniform attractors to the corresponding evolutionary processes generated by our model and to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of the attractors  in terms of the physical parameters of the system     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Efendiev M.A.; Murley J.; Sivaloganathan S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
176,Probabilistic Model for Control of an Epidemic by Isolation and Quarantine,Assuming a homogeneous population  we apply the mass action law for rate of new infections and a second order gamma distribution for removal probability to model spread of an epidemic  In numerical examinations of higher order gamma distributions for removal probability  we discover an unexpected pattern in maximum fraction of population infected  We develop from first principles of probability an eighth order system of ordinary differential equations to model effects of isolation and quarantine  We derive analytical expressions for reproduction numbers modeling isolation and quarantine when applied separately and together and verify them numerically  We quantify strength and speed required of these interventions to contain epidemics of varying severity and examine how their effectiveness depends on when they begin  We find that effectiveness is highly sensitive to small changes of intervention strength in a critical region  Finally  adding two more differential equations to capture natural population dynamics  we calculate endemic disease equilibria when affected by isolation and examine dynamics of coming to an equilibrium state     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Kalbaugh D.V.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
177,Modelling Oscillatory Patterns in the Bovine Estrous Cycle with Boolean Delay Equations,Boolean delay equations  BDEs   with their relatively simple and intuitive mode of modelling  have been used in many research areas including  for example  climate dynamics and earthquake propagation  Their application to biological systems has been scarce and limited to the molecular level  Here  we derive and present two BDE models  One is directly derived from a previously published ordinary differential equation  ODE  model for the bovine estrous cycle  whereas the second model includes a modification of a particular biological mechanism  We not only compare the simulation results from the BDE models with the trajectories of the ODE model  but also validate the BDE models with two additional numerical experiments  One experiment induces a switch in the oscillatory pattern upon changes in the model parameters  and the other simulates the administration of a hormone that is known to shift the estrous cycle in time  The models presented here are the first BDE models for hormonal oscillators  and the first BDE models for drug administration  Even though automatic parameter estimation still remains challenging  our results support the role of BDEs as a framework for the systematic modelling of complex biological oscillators     0    The Author s  ,Berg M.; Plöntzke J.; Siebert H.; Röblitz S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
178,Collective Oscillations in Coupled-Cell Systems,We investigate oscillations in coupled systems  The methodology is based on the Hopf bifurcation theorem and a condition extended from the Routh Hurwitz criterion  Such a condition leads to locating the bifurcation values of the parameters  With such an approach  we analyze a single cell system modeling the minimal genetic negative feedback loop and the coupled cell system composed by these single cell systems  We study the oscillatory properties for these systems and compare these properties between the model with Hill type repression and the one with protein sequestration based repression  As the parameters move from the Hopf bifurcation value for single cells to the one for coupled cells  we compute the eigenvalues of the linearized systems to obtain the magnitude of the collective frequency when the periodic solution of the coupled cell system is generated  Extending from this information on the parameter values  we further compute and compare the collective frequency for the coupled cell system and the average frequency of the decoupled individual cells  To compare these scenarios with other biological oscillators  we perform parallel analysis and computations on a segmentation clock model     0    The Author s  ,Chen K.-W.; Shih C.-W.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
179,Tipping Cascades in a Multi-patch System with Noise and Spatial Coupling,Forecasting tipping points in spatially extended systems is a key area of interest to ecologists  A slowly declining spatially distributed population is an important example of an ecological system that could exhibit a cascade of tipping points  Here  we develop a spatial two patch model with environmental stochasticity that is slowly forced through population collapse  in the presence of changing environmental conditions  We begin with a basic spatial model  then introduce a fast slow version of the model using geometric singular perturbation theory  followed by the inclusion of stochasticity  Using the spectral density of the fluctuating subpopulation in each patch  we derive analytic expressions for candidate indicators of population extinction and evaluate their performance through a simulation study  We find that coupling and spatial heterogeneity decrease the magnitude of the proposed indicators in coupled populations relative to isolated populations  Moreover  the degree of coupling dictates the trends in summary statistics  We conclude that this theory may be applied to other contexts  including the control of invasive species     0    The Author s  ,Mallela A.; Hastings A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
180,Parameter Estimation for Mixed-Mechanism Tear Film Thinning,Etiologies of tear breakup include evaporation driven  divergent flow driven  and a combination of these two  A mathematical model incorporating evaporation and lipid driven tangential flow is fit to fluorescence imaging data  The lipid driven motion is hypothesized to be caused by localized excess lipid  or  globs   Tear breakup quantities such as evaporation rates and tangential flow rates cannot currently be directly measured during breakup  We determine such variables by fitting mathematical models for tear breakup and the computed fluorescent intensity to experimental intensity data gathered in vivo  Parameter estimation is conducted via least squares minimization of the difference between experimental data and computed answers using either the trust region reflective or Levenberg Marquardt algorithm  Best fit determination of tear breakup parameters supports the notion that evaporation and divergent tangential flow can cooperate to drive breakup  The resulting tear breakup is typically faster than purely evaporative cases  Many instances of tear breakup may have similar causes  which suggests that interpretation of experimental results may benefit from considering multiple mechanisms     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Luke R.A.; Braun R.J.; Driscoll T.A.; Awisi-Gyau D.; Begley C.G.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

182,Reconstructing the Intrinsic Statistical Properties of Intermittent Locomotion Through Corrections for Boundary Effects,Locomotion characteristics are often recorded within bounded spaces  a constraint which introduces geometry specific biases and potentially complicates the inference of behavioural features from empirical observations  We describe how statistical properties of an uncorrelated random walk  namely the steady state stopping location probability density and the empirical step probability density  are affected by enclosure in a bounded space  The random walk here is considered as a null model for an organism moving intermittently in such a space  that is  the points represent stopping locations and the step is the displacement between them  Closed form expressions are derived for motion in one dimension and simple two dimensional geometries  in addition to an implicit expression for arbitrary  convex  geometries  For the particular choice of no go boundary conditions  we demonstrate that the empirical step distribution is related to the intrinsic step distribution  i e  the one we would observe in unbounded space  via a multiplicative transformation dependent solely on the boundary geometry  This conclusion allows in practice for the compensation of boundary effects and the reconstruction of the intrinsic step distribution from empirical observations     0    The Author s  ,Cocconi L.; Kuhn-Régnier A.; Neuss M.; Sendova-Franks A.B.; Christensen K.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
183,A Model to Investigate the Impact of Farm Practice on Antimicrobial Resistance in UK Dairy Farms,The ecological and human health impact of antibiotic use and the related antimicrobial resistance  AMR  in animal husbandry is poorly understood  In many countries  there has been considerable pressure to reduce overall antibiotic use in agriculture or to cease or minimise use of human critical antibiotics  However  a more nuanced approach would consider the differential impact of use of different antibiotic classes  for example  it is not known whether reduced use of bacteriostatic or bacteriolytic classes of antibiotics would be of greater value  We have developed an ordinary differential equation model to investigate the effects of farm practice on the spread and persistence of AMR in the dairy slurry tank environment  We model the chemical fate of bacteriolytic and bacteriostatic antibiotics within the slurry and their effect on a population of bacteria  which are capable of resistance to both types of antibiotic  Through our analysis  we find that changing the rate at which a slurry tank is emptied may delay the proliferation of multidrug resistant bacteria by up to five years depending on conditions  This finding has implications for farming practice and the policies that influence waste management practices  We also find that  within our model  the development of multidrug resistance is particularly sensitive to the use of bacteriolytic antibiotics  rather than bacteriostatic antibiotics  and this may be cause for controlling the usage of bacteriolytic antibiotics in agriculture     0    The Author s  ,Lanyon C.W.; King J.R.; Stekel D.J.; Gomes R.L.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
184,Modeling Intracellular Delay in Within-Host HIV Dynamics Under Conditioning of Drugs of Abuse,Drugs of abuse  such as opiates  have been widely associated with the enhancement of HIV replication  the acceleration of disease progression  and severe neuropathogenesis  Specifically  the presence of drugs of abuse  morphine  switches target cells  CD + T cells  from lower to higher susceptibility to HIV infection  The effect of such switching behaviors on viral dynamics may be altered due to the intracellular delay  the replication time between viral entry into a target cell and the production of new viruses by the infected cell   In this study  we develop  for the first time  a viral dynamics model that includes an intracellular delay under the conditioning of drugs of abuse  We parameterize the model using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus infection of morphine addicted macaques  Results from thorough mathematical analyses and numerical simulations of our model show that the intracellular delay can play a significant role in HIV dynamics under the conditioning of drugs of abuse  particularly during the acute phase of infection  Our model and the related results provide new insights into the HIV dynamics and may help develop strategies to control HIV infections in drug abusers     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Vaidya N.K.; Peter M.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
185,Evolution and Adaptation of Anti-predation Response of Prey in a Two-Patchy Environment,When perceiving a risk from predators  a prey may respond by reducing its reproduction and decreasing or increasing  depending on the species  its mobility  We formulate a patch model to investigate the aforementioned fear effect which is indirect  in contrast to the predation as a direct effect  of the predator on the prey population  We consider not only cost but also benefit of anti predation response of the prey  and explore their trade offs together as well as the impact of the fear effect mediated dispersals of the prey  In the case of constant response level  if there is no dispersal and for some given response functions  the model indicates the existence of an evolutionary stable strategy which is also a convergence stable strategy for the response level  and if there is dispersal  the analysis of the model shows that it will enhance the co persistence of the prey on both patches  Considering the trait as another variable  we continue to study the evolution of anti predation strategy for the model with dispersal  which leads to a three dimensional system of ordinary differential equations  We perform some numerical simulations  which demonstrate global convergence to a positive equilibrium with the response level evolving towards a positive constant level  implying the existence of an optimal anti predation response level     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Li A.; Zou X.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
186,Modeling the Effect of HIV/AIDS Stigma on HIV Infection Dynamics in Kenya,Stigma toward people living with HIV AIDS  PLWHA  has impeded the response to the disease across the world  Widespread stigma leads to poor adherence of preventative measures while also causing PLWHA to avoid testing and care  delaying important treatment  Stigma is clearly a hugely complex construct  However  it can be broken down into components which include internalized stigma  how people with the trait feel about themselves  and enacted stigma  how a community reacts to an individual with the trait   Levels of HIV AIDS related stigma are particularly high in sub Saharan Africa  which contributed to a surge in cases in Kenya during the late twentieth century  Since the early twenty first century  the United Nations and governments around the world have worked to eliminate stigma from society and resulting public health education campaigns have improved the perception of PLWHA over time  but HIV AIDS remains a significant problem  particularly in Kenya  We take a data driven approach to create a time dependent stigma function that captures both the level of internalized and enacted stigma in the population  We embed this within a compartmental model for HIV dynamics  Since  000  the population in Kenya has been growing almost exponentially and so we rescale our model system to create a coupled system for HIV prevalence and fraction of individuals that are infected that seek treatment  This allows us to estimate model parameters from published data  We use the model to explore a range of scenarios in which either internalized or enacted stigma levels vary from those predicted by the data  This analysis allows us to understand the potential impact of different public health interventions on key HIV metrics such as prevalence and disease related death and to see how close Kenya will get to achieving UN goals for these HIV and stigma metrics by  0 0     0    The Author s  ,Levy B.; Correia H.E.; Chirove F.; Ronoh M.; Abebe A.; Kgosimore M.; Chimbola O.; Machingauta M.H.; Lenhart S.; White K.A.J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
187,Oscillations and Pattern Formation in a Slow–Fast Prey–Predator System,We consider the properties of a slow fast prey predator system in time and space  We first argue that the simplicity of the prey predator system is apparent rather than real and there are still many of its hidden properties that have been poorly studied or overlooked altogether  We further focus on the case where  in the slow fast system  the prey growth is affected by a weak Allee effect  We first consider this system in the non spatial case and make its comprehensive study using a variety of mathematical techniques  In particular  we show that the interplay between the Allee effect and the existence of multiple timescales may lead to a regime shift where small amplitude oscillations in the population abundances abruptly change to large amplitude oscillations  We then consider the spatially explicit slow fast prey predator system and reveal the effect of different timescales on the pattern formation  We show that a decrease in the timescale ratio may lead to another regime shift where the spatiotemporal pattern becomes spatially correlated  leading to large amplitude oscillations in spatially average population densities and potential species extinction     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Chowdhury P.R.; Petrovskii S.; Banerjee M.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

189,Mosquito Control Based on Pesticides and Endosymbiotic Bacterium Wolbachia,Mosquito borne diseases  such as dengue fever and Zika  have posed a serious threat to human health around the world  Controlling vector mosquitoes is an effective method to prevent these diseases  Spraying pesticides has been the main approach of reducing mosquito population  but it is not a sustainable solution due to the growing insecticide resistance  One promising complementary method is the release of Wolbachia infected mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations  which has been proven to be a novel and environment friendly way for mosquito control  In this paper  we incorporate consideration of releasing infected sterile mosquitoes and spraying pesticides to aim to reduce wild mosquito populations based on the population replacement model  We present the estimations for the number of wild mosquitoes or infection density in a normal environment and then discuss how to offset the effect of the heatwave  which can cause infected mosquitoes to lose Wolbachia infection  Finally  we give the waiting time to suppress wild mosquito population to a given threshold size by numerical simulations     0    The Author s  ,Hu L.; Yang C.; Hui Y.; Yu J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

192,Modeling of Symbiotic Bacterial Biofilm Growth with an Example of the Streptococcus–Veillonella sp. System,We present a multi dimensional continuum mathematical model for modeling the growth of a symbiotic biofilm system  We take a dual species namely  the Streptococcus Veillonella sp  biofilm system as an example for numerical investigations  The presented model describes both the cooperation and competition between these species of bacteria  The coupled partial differential equations are solved by using an integrative finite element numerical strategy  Numerical examples are carried out for studying the evolution and distribution of the bio components  The results demonstrate that the presented model is capable of describing the symbiotic behavior of the biofilm system  However  homogenized numerical solutions are observed locally  To study the homogenization behavior of the model  numerical investigations regarding on how random initial biomass distribution influences the homogenization process are carried out  We found that a smaller correlation length of the initial biomass distribution leads to faster homogenization of the solution globally  however  shows more fluctuated biomass profiles along the biofilm thickness direction  More realistic scenarios with bacteria in patches are also investigated numerically in this study     0    The Author s  ,Feng D.; Neuweiler I.; Nogueira R.; Nackenhorst U.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
193,Mechanical Models of Pattern and Form in Biological Tissues: The Role of Stress–Strain Constitutive Equations,Mechanical and mechanochemical models of pattern formation in biological tissues have been used to study a variety of biomedical systems  particularly in developmental biology  and describe the physical interactions between cells and their local surroundings  These models in their original form consist of a balance equation for the cell density  a balance equation for the density of the extracellular matrix  ECM   and a force balance equation describing the mechanical equilibrium of the cell ECM system  Under the assumption that the cell ECM system can be regarded as an isotropic linear viscoelastic material  the force balance equation is often defined using the Kelvin Voigt model of linear viscoelasticity to represent the stress strain relation of the ECM  However  due to the multifaceted bio physical nature of the ECM constituents  there are rheological aspects that cannot be effectively captured by this model and  therefore  depending on the pattern formation process and the type of biological tissue considered  other constitutive models of linear viscoelasticity may be better suited  In this paper  we systematically assess the pattern formation potential of different stress strain constitutive equations for the ECM within a mechanical model of pattern formation in biological tissues  The results obtained through linear stability analysis and the dispersion relations derived therefrom support the idea that fluid like constitutive models  such as the Maxwell model and the Jeffrey model  have a pattern formation potential much higher than solid like models  such as the Kelvin Voigt model and the standard linear solid model  This is confirmed by the results of numerical simulations  which demonstrate that  all else being equal  spatial patterns emerge in the case where the Maxwell model is used to represent the stress strain relation of the ECM  while no patterns are observed when the Kelvin Voigt model is employed  Our findings suggest that further empirical work is required to acquire detailed quantitative information on the mechanical properties of components of the ECM in different biological tissues in order to furnish mechanical and mechanochemical models of pattern formation with stress strain constitutive equations for the ECM that provide a more faithful representation of the underlying tissue rheology     0    The Author s  ,Villa C.; Chaplain M.A.J.; Gerisch A.; Lorenzi T.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
194,Topological Data Analysis Approaches to Uncovering the Timing of Ring Structure Onset in Filamentous Networks,In developmental biology as well as in other biological systems  emerging structure and organization can be captured using time series data of protein locations  In analyzing this time dependent data  it is a common challenge not only to determine whether topological features emerge  but also to identify the timing of their formation  For instance  in most cells  actin filaments interact with myosin motor proteins and organize into polymer networks and higher order structures  Ring channels are examples of such structures that maintain constant diameters over time and play key roles in processes such as cell division  development  and wound healing  Given the limitations in studying interactions of actin with myosin in vivo  we generate time series data of protein polymer interactions in cells using complex agent based models  Since the data has a filamentous structure  we propose sampling along the actin filaments and analyzing the topological structure of the resulting point cloud at each time  Building on existing tools from persistent homology  we develop a topological data analysis  TDA  method that assesses effective ring generation in this dynamic data  This method connects topological features through time in a path that corresponds to emergence of organization in the data  In this work  we also propose methods for assessing whether the topological features of interest are significant and thus whether they contribute to the formation of an emerging hole  ring channel  in the simulated protein interactions  In particular  we use the MEDYAN simulation platform to show that this technique can distinguish between the actin cytoskeleton organization resulting from distinct motor protein binding parameters     0    The Author s  ,Ciocanel M.-V.; Juenemann R.; Dawes A.T.; McKinley S.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
195,Leadership Through Influence: What Mechanisms Allow Leaders to Steer a Swarm?,Collective migration of cells and animals often relies on a specialised set of  leaders   whose role is to steer a population of naive followers towards some target  We formulate a continuous model to understand the dynamics and structure of such groups  splitting a population into separate follower and leader types with distinct orientation responses  We incorporate leader influence via three principal mechanisms  a bias in the orientation of leaders towards the destination  orientation bias   a faster movement of leaders when moving towards the target  speed bias   and leaders making themselves more clear to followers when moving towards the target  conspicuousness bias   Analysis and numerical computation are used to assess the extent to which the swarm is successfully shepherded towards the target  We find that successful leadership can occur for each of these three mechanisms across a broad region of parameter space  with conspicuousness bias emerging as the most robust  However  outside this parameter space we also find various forms of unsuccessful leadership  Forms of excessive influence can result in either swarm splitting  where the leaders break free and followers are left rudderless  or a loss of swarm cohesion that leads to its eventual dispersal  Forms of low influence  on the other hand  can even generate swarms that move away from the target direction  Leadership must therefore be carefully managed to steer the swarm correctly     0    The Author s  ,Bernardi S.; Eftimie R.; Painter K.J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
196,Modeling and Parameter Subset Selection for Fibrin Polymerization Kinetics with Applications to Wound Healing,During the hemostatic phase of wound healing  vascular injury leads to endothelial cell damage  initiation of a coagulation cascade involving platelets  and formation of a fibrin rich clot  As this cascade culminates  activation of the protease thrombin occurs and soluble fibrinogen is converted into an insoluble polymerized fibrin network  Fibrin polymerization is critical for bleeding cessation and subsequent stages of wound healing  We develop a cooperative enzyme kinetics model for in vitro fibrin matrix polymerization capturing dynamic interactions among fibrinogen  thrombin  fibrin  and intermediate complexes  A tailored parameter subset selection technique is also developed to evaluate parameter identifiability for a representative data curve for fibrin accumulation in a short duration in vitro polymerization experiment  Our approach is based on systematic analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the classical information matrix for simulations of accumulating fibrin matrix via optimization based on a least squares objective function  Results demonstrate robustness of our approach in that a significant reduction in objective function cost is achieved relative to a more ad hoc curve fitting procedure  Capabilities of this approach to integrate non overlapping subsets of the data to enhance the evaluation of parameter identifiability are also demonstrated  Unidentifiable reaction rate parameters are screened to determine whether individual reactions can be eliminated from the overall system while preserving the low objective cost  These findings demonstrate the high degree of information within a single fibrin accumulation curve  and a tailored model and parameter subset selection approach for improving optimization and reducing model complexity in the context of polymerization experiments     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Pearce K.J.; Nellenbach K.; Smith R.C.; Brown A.C.; Haider M.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
197,Modeling the Pancreatic Cancer Microenvironment in Search of Control Targets,Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is among the leading causes of cancer related deaths globally due to its extreme difficulty to detect and treat  Recently  research focus has shifted to analyzing the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer to better understand its key molecular mechanisms  This microenvironment can be represented with a multi scale model consisting of pancreatic cancer cells  PCCs  and pancreatic stellate cells  PSCs   as well as cytokines and growth factors which are responsible for intercellular communication between the PCCs and PSCs  We have built a stochastic Boolean network  BN  model  validated by literature and clinical data  in which we probed for intervention strategies that force this gene regulatory network  GRN  from a diseased state to a healthy state  To do so  we implemented methods from phenotype control theory to determine a procedure for regulating specific genes within the microenvironment  We identified target genes and molecules  such that the application of their control drives the GRN to the desired state by suppression  or expression  and disruption of specific signaling pathways that may eventually lead to the eradication of the cancer cells  After applying well studied control methods such as stable motifs  feedback vertex sets  and computational algebra  we discovered that each produces a different set of control targets that are not necessarily minimal nor unique  Yet  we were able to gain more insight about the performance of each process and the overlap of targets discovered  Nearly every control set contains cytokines  KRas  and HER  neu  which suggests they are key players in the system s dynamics  To that end  this model can be used to produce further insight into the complex biological system of pancreatic cancer with hopes of finding new potential targets     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Plaugher D.; Murrugarra D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
198,Optimal Control of Plant Disease Epidemics with Clean Seed Usage,The distribution and use of pathogen free planting material   clean seeds   is a promising method to control plant diseases in developing countries  We address the question of minimizing disease prevalence in plants through the optimal usage of clean seeds  We consider the simplest possible S I model together with a simple economic criterion to be maximized  The static optimization problem shows a diversity of possible outcomes depending on economical and epidemiological parameters  We derive a simple condition showing to what extent subsidizing clean seeds relative to the epidemiological features of the disease may help eradicate or control the disease  Then we consider dynamic optimal control and Pontryagin s maximum principle to study the optimal usage of clean seeds to control the disease  The dynamical results are comparable to the static ones and are even simpler in some sense  In particular  the condition on the critical subsidy rate that makes clean seed usage economically viable is unchanged from the static optimization case  We discuss how these results may apply to the control of maize lethal necrosis in East Africa     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Hamelin F.M.; Bowen B.; Bernhard P.; Bokil V.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
199,A Mathematical Study of the Influence of Hypoxia and Acidity on the Evolutionary Dynamics of Cancer,Hypoxia and acidity act as environmental stressors promoting selection for cancer cells with a more aggressive phenotype  As a result  a deeper theoretical understanding of the spatio temporal processes that drive the adaptation of tumour cells to hypoxic and acidic microenvironments may open up new avenues of research in oncology and cancer treatment  We present a mathematical model to study the influence of hypoxia and acidity on the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cells in vascularised tumours  The model is formulated as a system of partial integro differential equations that describe the phenotypic evolution of cancer cells in response to dynamic variations in the spatial distribution of three abiotic factors that are key players in tumour metabolism  oxygen  glucose and lactate  The results of numerical simulations of a calibrated version of the model based on real data recapitulate the eco evolutionary spatial dynamics of tumour cells and their adaptation to hypoxic and acidic microenvironments  Moreover  such results demonstrate how nonlinear interactions between tumour cells and abiotic factors can lead to the formation of environmental gradients which select for cells with phenotypic characteristics that vary with distance from intra tumour blood vessels  thus promoting the emergence of intra tumour phenotypic heterogeneity  Finally  our theoretical findings reconcile the conclusions of earlier studies by showing that the order in which resistance to hypoxia and resistance to acidity arise in tumours depend on the ways in which oxygen and lactate act as environmental stressors in the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cells     0    The Author s  ,Fiandaca G.; Delitala M.; Lorenzi T.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
200,Mathematical Model of Tumour Spheroid Experiments with Real-Time Cell Cycle Imaging,Three dimensional   D  in vitro tumour spheroid experiments are an important tool for studying cancer progression and potential cancer drug therapies  Standard experiments involve growing and imaging spheroids to explore how different conditions lead to different rates of spheroid growth  These kinds of experiments  however  do not reveal any information about the spatial distribution of the cell cycle within the expanding spheroid  Since  00   a new experimental technology called fluorescent ubiquitination based cell cycle indicator  FUCCI  has enabled real time in situ visualisation of the cell cycle progression  Observations of  D tumour spheroids with FUCCI labelling reveal significant intratumoural structure  as the cell cycle status can vary with location  Although many mathematical models of tumour spheroid growth have been developed  none of the existing mathematical models are designed to interpret experimental observations with FUCCI labelling  In this work  we adapt the mathematical framework originally proposed by Ward and King  Math Med Biol     9  9   99   https   doi org  0  09  imammb       9  to produce a new mathematical model of FUCCI labelled tumour spheroid growth  The mathematical model treats the spheroid as being composed of three subpopulations   i  living cells in G  phase that fluoresce red   ii  living cells in S G  M phase that fluoresce green  and  iii  dead cells that are not fluorescent  We assume that the rates at which cells pass through different phases of the cell cycle  and the rate of cell death  depend upon the local oxygen concentration  Parameterising the new mathematical model using experimental measurements of cell cycle transition times  we show that the model can qualitatively capture important experimental observations that cannot be addressed using previous mathematical models  Further  we show that the mathematical model can be used to qualitatively mimic the action of anti mitotic drugs applied to the spheroid  All software programs required to solve the nonlinear moving boundary problem associated with the new mathematical model are available on GitHub  at https   github com wang jin mathbio Jin 0       0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Jin W.; Spoerri L.; Haass N.K.; Simpson M.J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
201,The Impact of Contact Structure and Mixing on Control Measures and Disease-Induced Herd Immunity in Epidemic Models: A Mean-Field Model Perspective,The contact structure of a population plays an important role in transmission of infection  Many  structured models  capture aspects of the contact pattern through an underlying network or a mixing matrix  An important observation in unstructured models of a disease that confers immunity is that once a fraction         R has been infected  the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic  A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals  because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine  preferentially immunising higher risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission  Therefore  a limited  first wave  may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted  In this paper  we set out to investigate this more systematically  While networks offer a flexible framework to model contact patterns explicitly  they suffer from several shortcomings   i  high fidelity network models require a large amount of data which can be difficult to harvest  and  ii  very few  if any  theoretical contact network models offer the flexibility to tune different contact network properties within the same framework  Therefore  we opt to systematically analyse a number of well known mean field models  These are computationally efficient and provide good flexibility in varying contact network properties such as heterogeneity in the number contacts  clustering and household structure or differentiating between local and global contacts  In particular  we consider the question of herd immunity under several scenarios  When modelling interventions as changes in transmission rates  we confirm that in networks with significant degree heterogeneity  the first wave of the epidemic confers herd immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with less or no degree heterogeneity  However  if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network  then this effect may become much more subtle  Indeed  modifying the structure disproportionately can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and therefore make the second wave more substantial  We strengthen this finding by using an age structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age specific structural changes  Overall  we find that results regarding  disease induced  herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model  the duration of the lockdown and how the lockdown is implemented in the model     0    The Author s  ,Di Lauro F.; Berthouze L.; Dorey M.D.; Miller J.C.; Kiss I.Z.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

205,Modeling the Relationship Between Antibody-Dependent Enhancement and Disease Severity in Secondary Dengue Infection,Sequential infections with different dengue serotypes  DENV       significantly increase the risk of a severe disease outcome  fever  shock  and hemorrhagic disorders   Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the severity of the disease      antibody dependent enhancement  ADE  and     original T cell antigenic sin  In this work  we explored the first hypothesis through mathematical modeling  The proposed model reproduces the dynamic of susceptible and infected target cells and dengue virus in scenarios of infection neutralizing and infection enhancing antibody competition induced by two distinct serotypes of the dengue virus during secondary infection  The enhancement and neutralization functions are derived from basic concepts of chemical reactions and used to mimic binding to the virus by two distinct populations of antibodies  The analytic study of the model showed the existence of two equilibriums  a disease free equilibrium and an endemic one  Using the concept of the basic reproduction numberR  we performed the asymptotic stability analysis for the two equilibriums  To measure the severity of the disease  we considered the maximum value of infected cells as well as the time when this maximum is reached  We observed that it corresponds to the time when the maximum enhancing activity for the infection occurs  This critical time was calculated from the model to be a few days after the occurrence of the infection  which corresponds to what is observed in the literature  Finally  using as output R  we were able to rank the contribution of each parameter of the model  In particular  we highlighted that the cross reactive antibody responses may be responsible for the disease enhancement during secondary heterologous dengue infection     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,de A.

207,How Local Interactions Impact the Dynamics of an Epidemic,Susceptible Infected Recovered  SIR  models have long formed the basis for exploring epidemiological dynamics in a range of contexts  including infectious disease spread in human populations  Classic SIR models take a mean field assumption  such that a susceptible individual has an equal chance of catching the disease from any infected individual in the population  In reality  spatial and social structure will drive most instances of disease transmission  Here we explore the impacts of including spatial structure in a simple SIR model  We combine an approximate mathematical model  using a pair approximation  and stochastic simulations to consider the impact of increasingly local interactions on the epidemic  Our key development is to allow not just extremes of  local   neighbour to neighbour  or  global   random  transmission  but all points in between  We find that even medium degrees of local interactions produce epidemics highly similar to those with entirely global interactions  and only once interactions are predominantly local do epidemics become substantially lower and later  We also show how intervention strategies to impose local interactions on a population must be introduced early if significant impacts are to be seen     0    The Author s  ,Wren L.; Best A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

211,Experimental Data and PBPK Modeling Quantify Antibody Interference in PEGylated Drug Carrier Delivery,Physiologically based pharmacokinetic  PBPK  modeling is a popular drug development tool that integrates physiology  drug physicochemical properties  preclinical data  and clinical information to predict drug systemic disposition  Since PBPK models seek to capture complex physiology  parameter uncertainty and variability is a prevailing challenge  there are often more compartments  e g   organs  each with drug flux and retention mechanisms  and associated model parameters  than can be simultaneously measured  To improve the fidelity of PBPK modeling  one approach is to search and optimize within the high dimensional model parameter space  based on experimental time series measurements of drug distributions  Here  we employ Latin Hypercube Sampling  LHS  on a PBPK model of PEG liposomes  PL  that tracks biodistribution in an   compartment mouse circulatory system  in the presence  APA+  or absence  na ve  of anti PEG antibodies  APA   Near continuous experimental measurements of PL concentration during the first hour post injection from the liver  spleen  kidney  muscle  lung  and blood plasma  based on PET CT imaging in live mice  are used as truth sets with LHS to infer optimal parameter ranges for the full PBPK model  The data and model quantify that PL retention in the liver is the primary differentiator of biodistribution patterns in na ve versus APA+ mice  and spleen the secondary differentiator  Retention of PEGylated nanomedicines is substantially amplified in APA+ mice  likely due to PL bound APA engaging specific receptors in the liver and spleen that bind antibody Fc domains  Our work illustrates how applying LHS to PBPK models can further mechanistic understanding of the biodistribution and antibody mediated clearance of specific drugs     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Talkington A.M.; Wessler T.; Lai S.K.; Cao Y.; Forest M.G.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
212,A Data-Driven Mathematical Model of the Heroin and Fentanyl Epidemic in Tennessee,Opioid addiction represents a major national health issue spanning decades  In recent years  prescription opioid use disorder has increasingly led to heroin and fentanyl use  with subsequent increases in mortality rates due to overdose  In this paper  we present a mechanistic  epidemic model for prescription opioid addiction and illicit heroin or fentanyl addiction which aims to better understand and predict the dynamics between these two stages of opioid use disorder  Our model aims to be both parsimonious and robust  as a system of five differential equations it is appropriate for use in theory advancement and yet it remains powerful enough to capture state level data from Tennessee for the period  0    0    A key finding from our data driven analysis is that  in the face of changing policy around prescription opioids  heroin and fentanyl are now the driving force behind the Tennessee opioid epidemic  Model projections suggest that both addictions and overdoses related to heroin and fentanyl will continue to increase in the next few years   0 0  0     even as addiction to prescription drugs continues to fall  Finally  management strategy analysis suggests that in the changing face of the epidemic  the most successful approach will target availability of treatment with subsequent monitoring of stably recovered individuals to see that they do not relapse  coincident with direct efforts to decrease opioid overdose fatalities  e g   further availability of Naloxone      0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Phillips T.; Lenhart S.; Strickland W.C.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
213,Diffusive Interface Model for Actomyosin Driven Cell Oscillations,In this paper  we build phase field models for the actomyosin driven cell oscillations  In our modeling  an oscillation starts from an actin cortex breakage  After the breakage  due to the unbalanced distribution of actin and myosin  there is unbalanced contraction force in different membrane components  which then results in the lipids transferring to the bulged membrane compartment  As such we can observe a cell oscillation  During the whole process  the actin and myosin polymerization and depolymerization play important roles  We give detailed formulations under the framework of phase field methodology  in which phase field functions are used to describe different parts of the cell membrane  integrated with the distribution of the actin and myosin at different components  The whole system is described as a set of time dependent partial differential equations in three dimensional space  Forward Euler method is used to solve the system  The spectral method is used for spatial discretizations for efficiency and accuracy purpose  Given carefully selected parameters  three dimensional simulations are performed and compared with biological images  The simulations prove that actomyosin dynamics are the major reasons for cell oscillations  Further  our method can be easily extended into the simulations of cell polarization  We also compared our numerical simulations with biological experiments  This modeling gives an example of applying diffusive interface methods toward complex biology experiments     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Wang X.; Zhu L.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
214,Harnessing Social Media in the Modelling of Pandemics—Challenges and Opportunities,As COVID  9 spreads throughout the world without a straightforward treatment or widespread vaccine coverage in the near future  mathematical models of disease spread and of the potential impact of mitigation measures have been thrust into the limelight  With their popularity and ability to disseminate information relatively freely and rapidly  information from social media platforms offers a user generated  spontaneous insight into users  minds that may capture beliefs  opinions  attitudes  intentions and behaviour towards outbreaks of infectious disease not obtainable elsewhere  The interactive  immersive nature of social media may reveal emergent behaviour that does not occur in engagement with traditional mass media or conventional surveys  In recognition of the dramatic shift to life online during the COVID  9 pandemic to mitigate disease spread and the increasing threat of further pandemics  we examine the challenges and opportunities inherent in the use of social media data in infectious disease modelling with particular focus on their inclusion in compartmental models     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Sooknanan J.; Mays N.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
215,Controlling the Spatial Spread of a Xylella Epidemic,In a recent paper by one of the authors and collaborators  motivated by the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome  OQDS  outbreak  which has been ongoing in Southern Italy since  0    a simple epidemiological model describing this epidemic was presented  Beside the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa  the main players considered in the model are its insect vectors  Philaenus spumarius  and the host plants  olive trees and weeds  of the insects and of the bacterium  The model was based on a system of ordinary differential equations  the analysis of which provided interesting results about possible equilibria of the epidemic system and guidelines for its numerical simulations  Although the model presented there was mathematically rather simplified  its analysis has highlighted threshold parameters that could be the target of control strategies within an integrated pest management framework  not requiring the removal of the productive resource represented by the olive trees  Indeed  numerical simulations support the outcomes of the mathematical analysis  according to which the removal of a suitable amount of weed biomass  reservoir of Xylella fastidiosa  from olive orchards and surrounding areas resulted in the most efficient strategy to control the spread of the OQDS  In addition  as expected  the adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good strategy  though less cost effective  in controlling the pathogen  In this paper for a more realistic description and a clearer interpretation of the proposed control measures  a spatial structure of the epidemic system has been included  but  in order to keep mathematical technicalities to a minimum  only two players have been described in a dynamical way  trees and insects  while the weed biomass is taken to be a given quantity  The control measures have been introduced only on a subregion of the whole habitat  in order to contain costs of intervention  We show that such a practice can lead to the eradication of an epidemic outbreak  Numerical simulations confirm both the results of the previous paper and the theoretical results of the model with a spatial structure  though subject to regional control only     0    The Author s  ,Aniţa S.; Capasso V.; Scacchi S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
216,Dispersal and Good Habitat Quality Promote Neutral Genetic Diversity in Metapopulations,Dispersal is a fundamental and crucial ecological process for a metapopulation to survive in heterogeneous or changing habitats  In this paper  we investigate the effect of the habitat quality and the dispersal on the neutral genetics diversity of a metapopulation  We model the metapopulation dynamics on heterogeneous habitats using a deterministic system of ordinary differential equations  We decompose the metapopulation into several neutral genetic fractions seeing as they could be located in different habitats  By using a mathematical model which describes their temporal dynamics inside the metapopulation  we provide the analytical results of their transient dynamics  as well as their asymptotic proportion in the different habitats  The diversity indices show how the genetic diversity at a global metapopulation scale is preserved by the correlation of two factors  the dispersal of the population  as well as the existence of adequate and sufficiently large habitats  The diversity indices show how the genetic diversity at a global metapopulation scale is preserved by the correlation of two factors  the dispersal of the population as well as the existence of adequate and sufficiently large habitats  Moreover  they ensure genetic diversity at the local habitat scale  In a source sink metapopulation  we demonstrate that the diversity of the sink can be rescued if the condition of the sink is not too deteriorated and the migration from the source is larger than the migration from the sink  Furthermore  our study provides an analytical insight into the dynamics of the solutions of the systems of ordinary differential equations     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Garnier J.; Lafontaine P.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
217,Atto-Foxes and Other Minutiae,This paper addresses the problem of extinction in continuous models of population dynamics associated with small numbers of individuals  We begin with an extended discussion of extinction in the particular case of a stochastic logistic model  and how it relates to the corresponding continuous model  Two examples of  small number dynamics  are then considered  The first is what Mollison calls the  atto fox  problem  in a model of fox rabies   referring to the problematic theoretical occurrence of a predicted rabid fox density of  0       atto   per square kilometre  The second is how the production of large numbers of eggs by an individual can reliably lead to the eventual survival of a handful of adults  as it would seem that extinction then becomes a likely possibility  We describe the occurrence of the atto fox problem in other contexts  such as the microbial  yocto cell  problem  and we suggest that the modelling resolution is to allow for the existence of a reservoir for the extinctively challenged individuals  This is functionally similar to the concept of a  refuge  in predator prey systems and represents a state for the individuals in which they are immune from destruction  For what I call the  frogspawn  problem  where only a few individuals survive to adulthood from a large number of eggs  we provide a simple explanation based on a Holling type   response and elaborate it by means of a suitable nonlinear age structured model     0    The Author s  ,Fowler A.C.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
218,Bayesian-Weighted Triplet and Quartet Methods for Species Tree Inference,Inference of the evolutionary histories of species  commonly represented by a species tree  is complicated by the divergent evolutionary history of different parts of the genome  Different loci on the genome can have different histories from the underlying species tree  and each other  due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting  ILS   gene duplication and loss  and horizontal gene transfer  The multispecies coalescent is a commonly used model for performing inference on species and gene trees in the presence of ILS  This paper introduces Lily T and Lily Q  two new methods for species tree inference under the multispecies coalescent  We then compare them to two frequently used methods  SVDQuartets and ASTRAL  using simulated and empirical data  Both methods generally showed improvement over SVDQuartets  and Lily Q was superior to Lily T for most simulation settings  The comparison to ASTRAL was more mixed Lily Q tended to be better than ASTRAL when the length of recombination free loci was short  when the coalescent population parameter   was small  or when the internal branch lengths were longer     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Richards A.; Kubatko L.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
219,Deep Learning of Biological Models from Data: Applications to ODE Models,Mathematical equations are often used to model biological processes  However  for many systems  determining analytically the underlying equations is highly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors involved in the biological processes  In this work  we present a numerical procedure to discover dynamical physical laws behind biological data  The method utilizes deep learning methods based on neural networks  particularly residual networks  It is also based on recently developed mathematical tools of flow map learning for dynamical systems  We demonstrate that with the proposed method  one can accurately construct numerical biological models for unknown governing equations behind measurement data  Moreover  the deep learning model can also incorporate unknown parameters in the biological process  A successfully trained deep neural network model can then be used as a predictive tool to produce system predictions of different settings and allows one to conduct detailed analysis of the underlying biological process  In this paper  we use three biological models SEIR model  Morris Lecar model and the Hodgkin Huxley model to show the capability of our proposed method     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Su W.-H.; Chou C.-S.; Xiu D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
220,Autophosphorylation and the Dynamics of the Activation of Lck,Lck  lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase  is an enzyme which plays a number of important roles in the function of immune cells  It belongs to the Src family of kinases which are known to undergo autophosphorylation  It turns out that this leads to a remarkable variety of dynamical behaviour which can occur during their activation  We prove that in the presence of autophosphorylation one phenomenon  bistability  already occurs in a mathematical model for a protein with a single phosphorylation site  We further show that a certain model of Lck exhibits oscillations  Finally  we discuss the relations of these results to models in the literature which involve Lck and describe specific biological processes  such as the early stages of T cell activation and the stimulation of T cell responses resulting from the suppression of PD   signalling which is important in immune checkpoint therapy for cancer     0    The Author s  ,Kreusser L.M.; Rendall A.D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
221,Towards Building a Sustainable Future: Positioning Ecological Modelling for Impact in Ecosystems Management,As many ecosystems worldwide are in peril  efforts to manage them sustainably require scientific advice  While numerous researchers around the world use a great variety of models to understand ecological dynamics and their responses to disturbances  only a small fraction of these models are ever used to inform ecosystem management  There seems to be a perception that ecological models are not useful for management  even though mathematical models are indispensable in many other fields  We were curious about this mismatch  its roots  and potential ways to overcome it  We searched the literature on recommendations and best practices for how to make ecological models useful to the management of ecosystems and we searched for  success stories  from the past  We selected and examined several cases where models were instrumental in ecosystem management  We documented their success and asked whether and to what extent they followed recommended best practices  We found that there is not a unique way to conduct a research project that is useful in management decisions  While research is more likely to have impact when conducted with many stakeholders involved and specific to a situation for which data are available  there are great examples of small groups or individuals conducting highly influential research even in the absence of detailed data  We put the question of modelling for ecosystem management into a socio economic and national context and give our perspectives on how the discipline could move forward     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,DeAngelis D.L.; Franco D.; Hastings A.; Hilker F.M.; Lenhart S.; Lutscher F.; Petrovskaya N.; Petrovskii S.; Tyson R.C.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
222,Spreading Properties for SIR Models on Homogeneous Trees,We consider an epidemic model of SIR type set on a homogeneous tree and investigate the spreading properties of the epidemic as a function of the degree of the tree  the intrinsic basic reproduction number and the strength of the interactions between the populations of infected individuals at each node  When the degree is one  the homogeneous tree is nothing but the standard lattice on the integers and our model reduces to a SIR model with discrete diffusion for which the spreading properties are very similar to the continuous case  On the other hand  when the degree is larger than two  we observe some new features in the spreading properties  Most notably  there exists a critical value of the strength of interactions above which spreading of the epidemic in the tree is no longer possible     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Besse C.; Faye G.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

225,Modeling CAR T-Cell Therapy with Patient Preconditioning,The Federal Drug Administration approved the first Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell  CAR T cell  therapies for the treatment of several blood cancers in  0    and efforts are underway to broaden CAR T technology to address other cancer types  Standard treatment protocols incorporate a preconditioning regimen of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T cell infusion  However  the connection between preconditioning regimens and patient outcomes is still not fully understood  Optimizing patient preconditioning plans and reducing the CAR T cell dose necessary for achieving remission could make therapy safer  In this paper  we test treatment regimens consisting of sequential administration of chemotherapy and CAR T cell therapy on a system of differential equations that models the tumor immune interaction  We use numerical simulations of treatment plans from within the scope of current medical practice to assess the effect of preconditioning plans on the success of CAR T cell therapy  Model results affirm clinical observations that preconditioning can be crucial for most patients  not just to reduce side effects  but to even achieve remission at all  We demonstrate that preconditioning plans using the same CAR T cell dose and the same total concentration of chemotherapy can lead to different patient outcomes due to different delivery schedules  Results from sensitivity analysis of the model parameters suggest that making small improvements in the effectiveness of CAR T cells in attacking cancer cells will significantly reduce the minimum dose required for successful treatment  Our modeling framework represents a starting point for evaluating the efficacy of patient preconditioning in the context of CAR T cell therapy     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Owens K.; Bozic I.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
226,Does Counting Different Life Stages Impact Estimates for Extinction Probabilities for Tsetse (Glossina spp)?,As insect populations decline  due to climate change and other environmental disruptions  there has been an increased interest in understanding extinction probabilities  Generally  the life cycle of insects occurs in well defined stages  when counting insects  questions naturally arise about which life stage to count  Using tsetse flies  vectors of trypanosomiasis  as a case study  we develop a model that works when different life stages are counted  Previous branching process models for tsetse populations only explicitly represent newly emerged adult female tsetse and use that subpopulation to keep track of population growth decline  Here  we directly model other life stages  We analyse reproduction numbers and extinction probabilities and show that several previous models used for estimating extinction probabilities for tsetse populations are special cases of the current model  We confirm that the reproduction number is the same regardless of which life stage is counted  and show how the extinction probability depends on which life stage we start from  We demonstrate  and provide a biological explanation for  a simple relationship between extinction probabilities for the different life stages  based on the probability of recruitment between stages  These results offer insights into insect population dynamics and provide tools that will help with more detailed models of tsetse populations  Population dynamics studies of insects should be clear about life stages and counting points     0    The Author s  ,Are E.B.; Hargrove J.W.; Dushoff J.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

229,The Role of Cytoplasmic MEX-5/6 Polarity in Asymmetric Cell Division,In the process of asymmetric cell division  the mother cell induces polarity in both the membrane and the cytosol by distributing substrates and components asymmetrically  Such polarity formation results from the harmonization of the upstream and downstream polarities between the cell membrane and the cytosol  MEX     is a well investigated downstream cytoplasmic protein  which is deeply involved in the membrane polarity of the upstream transmembrane protein PAR in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo  In contrast to the extensive exploration of membrane PAR polarity  cytoplasmic polarity is poorly understood  and the precise contribution of cytoplasmic polarity to the membrane PAR polarity remains largely unknown  In this study  we explored the interplay between the cytoplasmic MEX     polarity and the membrane PAR polarity by developing a mathematical model that integrates the dynamics of PAR and MEX     and reflects the cell geometry  Our investigations show that the downstream cytoplasmic protein MEX     plays an indispensable role in causing a robust upstream PAR polarity  and the integrated understanding of their interplay  including the effect of the cell geometry  is essential for the study of polarity formation in asymmetric cell division     0    The Author s  ,Seirin-Lee S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

233,Resonance in Physiologically Structured Population Models,Ecologists have long sought to understand how the dynamics of natural populations are affected by the environmental variation those populations experience  A transfer function is a useful tool for this purpose  as it uses linearization theory to show how the frequency spectrum of the fluctuations in a population s abundance relates to the frequency spectrum of environmental variation  Here  we show how to derive and to compute the transfer function for a continuous time model of a population that is structured by a continuous individual level state variable such as size  To illustrate  we derive  compute  and analyze the transfer function for a size structured population model of stony corals with open recruitment  parameterized for a common Indo Pacific coral species complex  This analysis identifies a sharp multi decade resonance driven by space competition between existing coral colonies and incoming recruits  The resonant frequency is most strongly determined by the rate at which colonies grow  and the potential for resonant oscillations is greatest when colony growth is only weakly density dependent  While these resonant oscillations are unlikely to be a predominant dynamical feature of degraded reefs  they suggest dynamical possibilities for marine invertebrates in more pristine waters  The size structured model that we analyze is a leading example of a broader class of physiologically structured population models  and the methods we present should apply to a wide variety of models in this class     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Gross K.; de Roos A.M.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
234,A Two-Dimensional Model of Potassium Signaling and Oscillatory Growth in a Biofilm,Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that exhibit a variety of collective behaviors  These behaviors improve their ability to survive in many different environments  One of these collective behaviors seen in Bacillus subtilis is the ability for starving cells to stop the growth of other cells using potassium signaling and voltage changes  This signaling produces an oscillatory growth pattern so that during periods of low growth the nutrients diffuse deeper into the biofilm and reach the nutrient starved  interior regions of the biomass  In this paper  we develop a mathematical model to describe this oscillatory behavior  and we use this model to develop a two dimensional simulation that reproduces many of the important features seen in the experimental data  This simulation allows us to examine the spatial patterning of the oscillatory behavior to better understand the relationships between the various regions of the biofilm  Studying the spatial components of the metabolic and voltage oscillations could allow for the development of new control techniques for biofilms with complex shapes     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Ford N.; Fisher G.; Prindle A.; Chopp D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

236,Isolating Patterns in Open Reaction–Diffusion Systems,Realistic examples of reaction diffusion phenomena governing spatial and spatiotemporal pattern formation are rarely isolated systems  either chemically or thermodynamically  However  even formulations of  open  reaction diffusion systems often neglect the role of domain boundaries  Most idealizations of closed reaction diffusion systems employ no flux boundary conditions  and often patterns will form up to  or along  these boundaries  Motivated by boundaries of patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic development  we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two species reaction diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the boundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics  with a prescribed uniform state near the boundary  We show that these boundary conditions can be derived from a larger heterogeneous field  indicating that these conditions can arise naturally if cell signalling or other properties of the medium vary in space  We explain the basic mechanisms behind this pattern localization and demonstrate that it can capture a large range of localized patterning in one  two  and three dimensions and that this framework can be applied to systems involving more than two species  Furthermore  the boundary conditions proposed lead to more symmetrical patterns on the interior of the domain and plausibly capture more realistic boundaries in developmental systems  Finally  we show that these isolated patterns are more robust to fluctuations in initial conditions and that they allow intriguing possibilities of pattern selection via geometry  distinct from known selection mechanisms     0    The Author s  ,Krause A.L.; Klika V.; Maini P.K.; Headon D.; Gaffney E.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
237,ATM and ATR Activation Through Crosstalk Between DNA Damage Response Pathways,Cells losing the ability to self regulate in response to damage are a hallmark of cancer  When a cell encounters damage  regulatory pathways estimate the severity of damage and promote repair  cell cycle arrest  or apoptosis  This decision making process would be remarkable if it were based on the total amount of damage in the cell  but because damage detection pathways vary in the rate and intensity with which they promote pro apoptotic factors  the cell s real challenge is to reconcile dissimilar signals  Crosstalk between repair pathways  crosstalk between pro apoptotic signaling kinases  and signals induced by damage by products complicate the process further  The cell s response to   and UV radiation neatly illustrates this concept  While these forms of radiation produce lesions associated with two different pro apoptotic signaling kinases  ATM and ATR  recent experiments show that ATM and ATR react to both forms of radiation  To simulate the pro apoptotic signal induced by   and UV radiation  we construct a mathematical model that includes three modes of crosstalk between ATM and ATR signaling pathways  positive feedback between ATM ATR and repair proteins  ATM and ATR mutual upregulation  and changes in lesion topology induced by replication stress or repair  We calibrate the model to agree with    experimental claims about ATM and ATR crosstalk  We alter the model by adding or removing specific processes and then examine the effects of each process on ATM ATR crosstalk by recording which claims the altered model violates  Not only is this the first mathematical model of ATM ATR crosstalk  it provides a strong argument for treating pro apoptotic signaling as a holistic effort rather than attributing it to a single dominant kinase     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Fedak E.A.; Adler F.R.; Abegglen L.M.; Schiffman J.D.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
238,The Role of Antigen-Competitive Dynamics in Regulating the Immune Response,The clonal expansion of T cells during an infection is tightly regulated to ensure an appropriate immune response against invading pathogens  Although experiments have mapped the trajectory from expansion to contraction  the interplay between mechanisms that control this response is not fully understood  Based on experimental data  we propose a model in which the dynamics of CD + T cell expansion is controlled through the interactions between T cells and antigen presenting cells  where T cell stimulation is proportional to antigen availability  and antigen availability is regulated through downregulation of antigen by T cells  This antigen dependent feedback mechanism operates alongside an intrinsic reduction in cell proliferation rate that may also be responsible for slowing expansion  Our model can successfully predict T cell recruitment rates into division  expansion  and clonal burst size per cell when initial precursors are varied or when T cells are introduced late into an ongoing immune response  Importantly  the findings demonstrate that a feedback mechanism between T cells and antigen presenting cells  along with a reduction in cell proliferation rate  can explain the ability of the immune system to adapt its response to variations in initial conditions or changes that occur later in the response  ensuring a robust yet controlled line of defence against pathogens     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Pooladvand P.; Kim P.S.; Fazekas de St Groth B.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
239,Effects of Prey’s Diffusion on Predator–Prey Systems with Two Patches,This paper considers predator prey systems in which the prey can move between source and sink patches  First  we give a complete analysis on global dynamics of the model  Then  we show that when diffusion from the source to sink is not large  the species would coexist at a steady state  when the diffusion is large  the predator goes to extinction  while the prey persists in both patches at a steady state  when the diffusion is extremely large  both species go to extinction  It is derived that diffusion in the system could lead to results reversing those without diffusion  That is  diffusion could change species  coexistence if non diffusing  to extinction of the predator  and even to extinction of both species  Furthermore  we show that intermediate diffusion to the sink could make the prey reach total abundance higher than if non diffusing  larger or smaller diffusion rates are not favorable  The total abundance  as a function of diffusion rates  can be both hump shaped and bowl shaped  which extends previous theory  A novel finding of this work is that there exist diffusion scenarios which could drive the predator into extinction and make the prey reach the maximal abundance  Diffusion from the sink to source and asymmetry in diffusion could also lead to results reversing those without diffusion  Meanwhile  diffusion always leads to reduction of the predator s density  The results are biologically important in protection of endangered species     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Xiao S.; Wang Y.; Wang S.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
240,Modeling the Effects of Latency Reversing Drugs During HIV-1 and SIV Brain Infection with Implications for the “Shock and Kill” Strategy,Combination antiretroviral therapy  cART  has greatly increased life expectancy for human immunodeficiency virus    HIV    infected patients  Even given the remarkable success of cART  the virus persists in many different cells and tissues  The presence of viral reservoirs represents a major obstacle to HIV   eradication  These viral reservoirs contain latently infected long lived cells  The  Shock and Kill  therapeutic strategy aims to reactivate latently infected cells by latency reversing agents  LRAs  and kill these reactivated cells by strategies involving the host immune system  The brain is a natural anatomical reservoir for HIV   infection  Brain macrophages  including microglia and perivascular macrophages  display productive HIV   infection  A mathematical model was used to analyze the dynamics of latently and productively infected brain macrophages during viral infection and this mathematical model enabled prediction of the effects of LRAs applied to the  Shock and Kill  strategy in the brain  The model was calibrated using reported data from simian immunodeficiency virus  SIV  studies  Our model produces the overarching observation that effective cART can suppress productively infected brain macrophages but leaves a residual latent viral reservoir in brain macrophages  In addition  our model demonstrates that there exists a parameter regime wherein the  Shock and Kill  strategy can be safe and effective for SIV infection in the brain  The results indicate that the  Shock and Kill  strategy can restrict brain viral RNA burden associated with severe neuroinflammation and can lead to the eradication of the latent reservoir of brain macrophages     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Roda W.C.; Liu S.; Power C.; Li M.Y.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
241,"Host Specialisation, Immune Cross-Reaction and the Composition of Communities of Co-circulating Borrelia Strains",We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members  The model is quite general and broadly applicable  but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi  the Lyme disease bacterium  transmitted by ticks to mice and birds  In this system  host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism  while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence  Our model is composed of two host species  one vector  and multiple co circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another  We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity  We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure  Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive  However  broad patterns are evident  When antigenic differentiation is weak  stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well  As antigenic differentiation increases  more diverse stable communities emerge  typically around trait compositions of generalists  generalists and very similar specialists  and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species     0    The Author s  ,Adams B.; Walter K.S.; Diuk-Wasser M.A.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

247,Modeling Rabies Transmission in Spatially Heterogeneous Environments via θ -diffusion,Rabies among dogs remains a considerable risk to humans and constitutes a serious public health concern in many parts of the world  Conventional mathematical models for rabies typically assume homogeneous environments  with a standard diffusion term for the population of rabid animals  It has recently been recognized  however  that spatial heterogeneity plays an important role in determining spatial patterns of rabies and the cost effectiveness of vaccinations  In this paper  we develop a spatially heterogeneous dog rabies model by using the   diffusion equation  where   reflects the way individual dogs make movement decisions in the underlying random walk  We numerically investigate the dynamics of the model in three diffusion cases  homogeneous  city wild  and Gaussian type  We find that the initial conditions affect whether traveling waves or epizootic waves can be observed  However  different initial conditions have little impact on steady state solutions  An  active  interface is observed between city and wild regions  with a  ridge  on the city side and a  valley  on the wild side for the infectious dog population  In addition  the progressing speed of epizootic waves changes in heterogeneous environments  It is impossible to eliminate rabies in the entire spatial domain if vaccination is focused only in the city region or only in the wild region  When a seasonal transmission is incorporated  the dog population size approaches a positive time periodic spatially heterogeneous state eventually     0    The Author s   under exclusive licence to Society for Mathematical Biology ,Wang X.; Wang H.; Li M.Y.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology
248,A Dynamic Model to Assess Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Strategies in a Heterosexual Population Combined with Men Who have Sex with Men,Vaccination is effective in preventing human papillomavirus  HPV  infection  It is imperative to investigate who should be vaccinated and what the best vaccine distribution strategy is  In this paper  we use a dynamic model to assess HPV vaccination strategies in a heterosexual population combined with gay  bisexual  and other men who have sex with men  MSM   The basic reproduction numbers for heterosexual females  heterosexual males and MSM as well as their average for the total population are obtained  We also derive a threshold parameter  based on basic reproduction numbers  for model analysis  From the analysis and numerical investigations  we have several conclusions      To eliminate HPV infection  the priority of vaccination should be given to MSM  especially in countries that have already achieved high coverage in females  The heterosexual population gets great benefit but MSM only get minor benefit from vaccinating heterosexual females or males      The best vaccination strategy is to vaccinate MSM firstly as many as possible  then heterosexual females  lastly heterosexual males      Given a fixed vaccination coverage of MSM  distributing the remaining vaccines to only heterosexual females or males leads to a similar prevalence in the total population  This prevalence is lower than that when vaccines are distributed to both genders  The evener the distribution  the higher the prevalence in the total population      Vaccination becomes less effective in reducing the prevalence as more vaccines are given  It is more effective to allocate vaccines to a region with lower vaccination coverage  This study provides information that may help policymakers formulate guidelines for vaccine distribution to reduce HPV prevalence on the basis of vaccine availability and prior vaccination coverage  Whether these guidelines are affected when the objective is to reduce HPV associated cancer incidence remains to be further studied     0    Society for Mathematical Biology ,Gao S.; Martcheva M.; Miao H.; Rong L.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

252,A Two-Step Model of Human Entrainment: A Quantitative Study of Circadian Period and Phase of Entrainment,One of the essential characteristics of an authentic circadian clock is that the free running period sustains an approximately    hour cycle  When organisms are exposed to an external stimulus  the endogenous oscillators synchronize to the cycling environment signal in a process known as entrainment  These environmental cues perform an important role in resetting the phase and period of the circadian clock  A  generalized assumption  states that when an organism has a short period  it will experience a phase advance  while an organism with a long period experiences a phase delay  Despite widespread use  this positive relationship relating period to the phase of entrainment does not describe all known experimental data  We developed a two step entrainment model to explain a broader range of results as well as provide more quantitative analysis  We prove existence and stability of periodic orbits and given analytical solutions of the range of entrainment  fit the phase trajectory over the entire entrainment process to data from a published study for    subjects in extended day cycles  i e   longer than    h  Our simulations closely replicated the phase data and predicted correctly the phase of entrainment  We investigate the factors related to the rate of entrainment  ROE  and present the three dimensional parameter spaces  illustrating the various behaviors of the phase of entrainment and ROE  Our findings can be applied to diagnostics and treatments for patients with sleep disorders caused by shift work or jet lag     0    Society for Mathematical Biology ,An Z.; Merrill N.J.; Lee K.; Robin R.; Hayat A.; Zapfe O.; Piccoli B.,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology

261,Sensitivity analysis of the reaction occurrence and recurrence times in steady-state biochemical networks,Continuous time stationary Markov jump processes among discrete sites are encountered in disparate biochemical ambits  Sites and connecting dynamical events form a  network  in which the sites are the available system s states  and the events are site to site transitions  or even neutral processes in which the system does not change site but the event is however detectable  Examples include conformational transitions in single biomolecules  stochastic chemical kinetics in the space of the molecules copy numbers  and even macroscopic steady state reactive mixtures if one adopts the viewpoint of a tagged molecule  or even of a molecular moiety  whose state may change when it is involved in a chemical reaction  Among the variety of dynamical descriptors  here we focus on the first occurrence times  starting from a given site  and on the recurrence times of an event of interest  We develop the sensitivity analysis for the lowest moments of the statistical distribution of such times with respect to the rate constants of the network  In particular  simple expressions and inequalities allow us to establish a direct relationship between selective variation of rate constants and effect on average times and variances  As illustrative cases we treat the substrate inhibition in enzymatic catalysis in which a tagged enzyme molecule jumps between three states  and the basic two site model of stochastic gene expression in which the single gene switches between active and inactive forms     0 0 Elsevier Inc ,Frezzato D.,Mathematical Biosciences
262,Measuring tree balance using symmetry nodes — A new balance index and its extremal properties,Effects like selection in evolution as well as fertility inheritance in the development of populations can lead to a higher degree of asymmetry in evolutionary trees than expected under a null hypothesis  To identify and quantify such influences  various balance indices were proposed in the phylogenetic literature and have been in use for decades  However  so far no balance index was based on the number of symmetry nodes  even though symmetry nodes play an important role in other areas of mathematical phylogenetics and despite the fact that symmetry nodes are a quite natural way to measure balance or symmetry of a given tree  The aim of this manuscript is thus twofold  First  we will introduce the symmetry nodes index as an index for measuring balance of phylogenetic trees and analyze its extremal properties  We also show that this index can be calculated in linear time  This new index turns out to be a generalization of a simple and well known balance index  namely the cherry index  as well as a specialization of another  less established  balance index  namely Rogers  J index  Thus  it is the second objective of the present manuscript to compare the new symmetry nodes index to these two indices and to underline its advantages  In order to do so  we will derive some extremal properties of the cherry index and Rogers  J index along the way and thus complement existing studies on these indices  Moreover  we used the programming language R to implement all three indices in the software package symmeTree  which has been made publicly available     0   Elsevier Inc ,Kersting S.J.; Fischer M.,Mathematical Biosciences
263,Determining the effects of wind-aided midge movement on the outbreak and coexistence of multiple bluetongue virus serotypes in patchy environments,Bluetongue virus  BTV  has    serotypes with some of them coexisting in different environments which make its control difficult  Wind aided midge movement is a known mechanism in the spread of BTV  However  its effects on the dynamics of multiple BTV serotypes are not clear  Ordinary differential equation  ODE  and continuous time Markov chain  CTMC  models for two BTV serotypes in an environment divided into two patches depending on the risk of infection are formulated and analysed  By approximating the CTMC model with a multitype branching process  an estimate for the probability of a major outbreak of two BTV serotypes is obtained  It is shown that without movement a major outbreak occurs in the high risk patch  but with cattle or midge movement it occurs in both patches  When a major outbreak occurs  numerical simulations of the ODE model illustrate possible coexistence in both patches if the patches are connected by midge or cattle movement  Sensitivity analysis  based on the Latin hypercube sampling method  identified midge mortality and biting rates as being the most important in determining the magnitude of the probability of a major outbreak  These results indicate the significance of wind aided midge movement on the outbreak and coexistence of multiple BTV serotypes in patchy environments     0  ,Mugabi F.; Duffy K.J.; Mugisha J.Y.T.; Collins O.C.,Mathematical Biosciences

266,A minimal model of T cell avidity may identify subtherapeutic vaccine schedules,T cells protect the body from cancer by recognising tumour associated antigens  Recognising these antigens depends on multiple factors  one of which is T cell avidity  i e   the total interaction strength between a T cell and a cancer cell  While both high  and low avidity T cells can kill cancer cells  durable anti cancer immune responses require the selection of high avidity T cells  Previous experimentation with anti cancer vaccines  however  has shown that most vaccines elicit low avidity T cells  Optimising vaccine schedules may remedy this by preferentially selecting high avidity T cells  Here  we use mathematical modelling to develop a simple  phenomenological model of avidity selection that may identify vaccine schedules that disproportionately favour low avidity T cells  We calibrate our model to our prior  more complex model  and then validate it against several experimental data sets  We find that the sensitivity of the model s parameters change with vaccine dosage  which allows us to use a patient s data and clinical history to screen for suitable vaccine strategies     0   Elsevier Inc ,Kumbhari A.; Rose D.; Lee P.P.; Kim P.S.,Mathematical Biosciences
267,Mathematical modeling of spatio-temporal population dynamics and application to epidemic spreading,Agent based models  ABMs  are a useful tool for modeling spatio temporal population dynamics  where many details can be included in the model description  Their computational cost though is very high and for stochastic ABMs a lot of individual simulations are required to sample quantities of interest  Especially  large numbers of agents render the sampling infeasible  Model reduction to a metapopulation model leads to a significant gain in computational efficiency  while preserving important dynamical properties  Based on a precise mathematical description of spatio temporal ABMs  we present two different metapopulation approaches  stochastic and piecewise deterministic  and discuss the approximation steps between the different models within this framework  Especially  we show how the stochastic metapopulation model results from a Galerkin projection of the underlying ABM onto a finite dimensional ansatz space  Finally  we utilize our modeling framework to provide a conceptual model for the spreading of COVID  9 that can be scaled to real world scenarios     0   Elsevier Inc ,Winkelmann S.; Zonker J.; Schütte C.; Conrad N.D.,Mathematical Biosciences
268,Matrix and agent-based modeling of threats to a diamond-backed terrapin population,Population models are important tools for evaluating human impacts and potential management approaches on declining species  However  often studies are limited by constraints of the specific modeling approach  In this study we considered the persistence of a diamond backed terrapin  Malaclemys terrapin  population using two distinct modeling approaches  Two of the models were deterministic matrix models  Analysis of the discrete non spatial models showed that female adult survival rate had the largest positive impact on population growth while delaying sexual maturity decreased population growth  The matrix models also demonstrated that an increase in crab traps skewed the sex ratio of the population in favor of females  The third model was a stochastic agent based formulation that evaluated how increases in the number of crab traps and frequency of nest disturbances affected the long term viability of diamond backed terrapins  The spatial agent based model revealed how terrapin mortality was highly sensitive to the proximity of traps to the primary terrapin habitat  Results from this project improve our understanding of threats to diamond backed terrapins and can be used to guide conservation efforts     0   Elsevier Inc ,Levy B.; Windoloski K.; Ludlam J.,Mathematical Biosciences

270,Spatial modeling and dynamics of organic matter biodegradation in the absence or presence of bacterivorous grazing,Biodegradation is a pivotal natural process for elemental recycling and preservation of an ecosystem  Mechanistic modeling of biodegradation has to keep track of chemical elements via stoichiometric theory  under which we propose and analyze a spatial movement model in the absence or presence of bacterivorous grazing  Sensitivity analysis shows that the organic matter degradation rate is most sensitive to the grazer s death rate when the grazer is present and most sensitive to the bacterial death rate when the grazer is absent  Therefore  these two death rates are chosen as the primary parameters in the conditions of most mathematical theorems  The existence  stability and persistence of solutions are proven by applying linear stability analysis  local and global bifurcation theory  and the abstract persistence theory  Through numerical simulations  we obtain the transient and asymptotic dynamics and explore the effects of all parameters on the organic matter decomposition  Grazers either facilitate biodegradation or has no impact on biodegradation  which resolves the  decomposition facilitation paradox  in the spatial context     0 0 Elsevier Inc ,Chang X.; Shi J.; Wang H.,Mathematical Biosciences

272,Defining phylogenetic networks using ancestral profiles,Rooted phylogenetic networks provide a more complete representation of the ancestral relationship between species than phylogenetic trees when reticulate evolutionary processes are at play  One way to reconstruct a phylogenetic network is to consider its  ancestral profile   the number of paths from each ancestral vertex to each leaf   In general  this information does not uniquely determine the underlying phylogenetic network  A recent paper considered a new class of phylogenetic networks called  orchard networks  where this uniqueness was claimed to hold  Here we show that an additional restriction on the network  that of being  stack free   is required in order for the original uniqueness claim to hold  On the other hand  if the additional stack free restriction is lifted  we establish an alternative result  namely  there is uniqueness within the class of orchard networks up to the resolution of vertices of high in degree     0   Elsevier Inc ,Bai A.; Erdős P.L.; Semple C.; Steel M.,Mathematical Biosciences
273,Uniqueness of weakly reversible and deficiency zero realizations of dynamical systems,A reaction network together with a choice of rate constants uniquely gives rise to a system of differential equations  according to the law of mass action kinetics  On the other hand  different networks can generate the same dynamical system under mass action kinetics  Therefore  the problem of identifying  the  underlying network of a dynamical system is not well posed  in general  Here we show that the problem of identifying an underlying weakly reversible deficiency zero network is well posed  in the sense that the solution is unique whenever it exists  This can be very useful in applications because from the perspective of both dynamics and network structure  a weakly reversible deficiency zero  WR0  realization is the simplest possible one  Moreover  while mass action systems can exhibit practically any dynamical behavior  including multistability  oscillations  and chaos  WR0 systems are remarkably stable for any choice of rate constants  they have a unique positive steady state within each invariant polyhedron  and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics  We also prove that both of our hypotheses  i e   weak reversibility and deficiency zero  are necessary for uniqueness     0   Elsevier Inc ,Craciun G.; Jin J.; Yu P.Y.,Mathematical Biosciences
274,The inverse correlation between robustness and sensitivity to autoregulation in two-component systems,Two component systems  TCS  are signal transduction systems in bacteria and many other organisms that relay the sensory signal to genetic components  TCS consist of two proteins  a histidine kinase and a response regulator that the histidine kinase activates  This seemingly simple machinery can generate complex regulatory dynamics that enables the level of gene expression that matches the input signal  many TCS response regulators act on their own genes as transcription factors  resulting in a positive autoregulation mechanism  This regulation  in return  modulates the transcription factor activity as a function of the input signal  Positive autoregulation does not necessarily result in positive feedback  Sensitivity to autoregulation is quantified as the output level amplification resulting from the positive autoregulation mechanism  Another structural property of these systems is formally characterized as  robustness   in a robust TCS  the output of the system is solely a function of the input signal  Thus  a robust TCS remains insensitive to fluctuations in the concentrations of its protein components and  this way  maintains the precision in the output transcription factor activity in response to input stimulus  In this paper  we show with a formal model that TCS operate on a spectrum of inverse correlation between robustness and sensitivity to autoregulation  Our model predicts that the modulation by positive autoregulation is a function of loss in TCS robustness  for example  by spontaneous dephosphorylation of the histidine kinase  Consequently  the loss in robustness provides a proportional modulation by positive autoregulation to widen the response range with a scaled amplification of the output  At the other end of the spectrum  in the presence of a strictly robust TCS machinery  amplification of the transcription factor activity by autoregulation is diminished  We show that our results are in agreement with published experimental results  Our results suggest that these TCS evolve to converge at a trade off between robustness and positive autoregulation     0   Elsevier Inc ,Righetti E.; Kahramanoğulları O.,Mathematical Biosciences
275,The role of viral infectivity in oncolytic virotherapy outcomes: A mathematical study,A model capturing the dynamics between virus and tumour cells in the context of oncolytic virotherapy is presented and analysed  The ability of the virus to be internalised by uninfected cells is described by an infectivity parameter  which is inferred from available experimental data  The parameter is also able to describe the effects of changes in the tumour environment that affect viral uptake from tumour cells  Results show that when a virus is inoculated inside a growing tumour  strategies for enhancing infectivity do not lead to a complete eradication of the tumour  Within typical times of experiments and treatments  we observe the onset of oscillations  which always prevent a full destruction of the tumour mass  These findings are in good agreement with available laboratory results  Further analysis shows why a fully successful therapy cannot exist for the proposed model and that care must be taken when designing and engineering viral vectors with enhanced features  In particular  bifurcation analysis reveals that creating longer lasting virus particles or using strategies for reducing infected cell lifespan can cause unexpected and unwanted surges in the overall tumour load over time  Our findings suggest that virotherapy alone seems unlikely to be effective in clinical settings unless adjuvant strategies are included     0 0,Pooladvand P.; Yun C.-O.; Yoon A.-R.; Kim P.S.; Frascoli F.,Mathematical Biosciences

290,Physics-based modeling of Age-related Macular Degeneration—A theoretical approach to quantify retinal and choroidal contributions to macular oxygenation,We developed a mathematical model to characterize how macular oxygenation may be affected by abnormalities in the retinal and choroidal oxygen supplies  The macular region is modeled as a layered structure including  ganglion cell and nerve fiber layers  inner plexiform layer  inner nuclear layer  outer plexiform layer  outer nuclear layer  inner segment of photoreceptors layer and retinal pigmented epithelium  Each layer is characterized by specific levels of oxygen consumption  The vitreous and the choroid are located at the macula boundary and provide oxygen via boundary conditions of Dirichlet type  The three capillary plexi  superficial  intermediate  and deep  of the retinal circulation pierce the macular layers and provide oxygen via a volumetric source that depends on the retinal blood flow  Oxygen profiles through the macular tissue are calculated by simulating the balance among oxygen supply  consumption and diffusion in   a  physiological baseline conditions   b  retinal blood flow reduced by  0    0  and  0  with respect to baseline   c  choroidal oxygen level diminished by  0    0  and  0  with respect to baseline  Model simulations predict that      the oxygenation of the foveal avascular zone is not affected by reduction in retinal blood flow      a reduction in choroidal oxygen supply significantly affects the outer layers  especially the photoreceptors and outer nuclear layers      the impact of reduction in choroidal oxygen supply is larger in the region more proximal to the macular center      the impact of reduction in retinal blood flow is larger in the region more proximal to the macular periphery  The proposed mathematical model suggests that changes in retinal and choroidal oxygen supplies impact the oxygenation of the macular tissue differentially  These results may help better understand the pathogenesis of macular degeneration     0   Elsevier Inc ,Verticchio Vercellin A.C.; Harris A.; Chiaravalli G.; Sacco R.; Siesky B.; Ciulla T.; Guidoboni G.,Mathematical Biosciences
291,A note on tools for prediction under uncertainty and identifiability of SIR-like dynamical systems for epidemiology,We provide an overview of the methods that can be used for prediction under uncertainty and data fitting of dynamical systems  and of the fundamental challenges that arise in this context  The focus is on SIR like models  that are being commonly used when attempting to predict the trend of the COVID  9 pandemic  In particular  we raise a warning flag about identifiability of the parameters of SIR like models  often  it might be hard to infer the correct values of the parameters from data  even for very simple models  making it non trivial to use these models for meaningful predictions  Most of the points that we touch upon are actually generally valid for inverse problems in more general setups     0 0 Elsevier Inc ,Piazzola C.; Tamellini L.; Tempone R.,Mathematical Biosciences
292,Optimal allocation of limited vaccine to control an infectious disease: Simple analytical conditions,When allocating limited vaccines to control an infectious disease  policy makers frequently have goals relating to individual health benefits  e g   reduced morbidity and mortality  as well as population level health benefits  e g   reduced transmission and possible disease eradication   We consider the optimal allocation of a limited supply of a preventive vaccine to control an infectious disease  and four different allocation objectives  minimize new infections  deaths  life years lost  or quality adjusted life years  QALYs  lost due to death  We consider an SIR model with n interacting populations  and a single allocation of vaccine at time 0  We approximate the model dynamics to develop simple analytical conditions characterizing the optimal vaccine allocation for each objective  We instantiate the model for an epidemic similar to COVID  9 and consider n   population groups  one group  individuals under age     with high transmission but low mortality and the other group  individuals age    or older  with low transmission but high mortality  We find that it is optimal to vaccinate younger individuals to minimize new infections  whereas it is optimal to vaccinate older individuals to minimize deaths  life years lost  or QALYs lost due to death  Numerical simulations show that the allocations resulting from our conditions match those found using much more computationally expensive algorithms such as exhaustive search  Sensitivity analysis on key parameters indicates that the optimal allocation is robust to changes in parameter values  The simple conditions we develop provide a useful means of informing vaccine allocation decisions for communicable diseases     0   Elsevier Inc ,Rao I.J.; Brandeau M.L.,Mathematical Biosciences
293,Cell orientation under stretch: Stability of a linear viscoelastic model,The sensitivity of cells to alterations in the microenvironment and in particular to external mechanical stimuli is significant in many biological and physiological circumstances  In this regard  experimental assays demonstrated that  when a monolayer of cells cultured on an elastic substrate is subject to an external cyclic stretch with a sufficiently high frequency  a reorganization of actin stress fibres and focal adhesions happens in order to reach a stable equilibrium orientation  characterized by a precise angle between the cell major axis and the largest strain direction  To examine the frequency effect on the orientation dynamics  we propose a linear viscoelastic model that describes the coupled evolution of the cellular stress and the orientation angle  We find that cell orientation oscillates tending to an angle that is predicted by the minimization of a very general orthotropic elastic energy  as confirmed by a bifurcation analysis  Moreover  simulations show that the speed of convergence towards the predicted equilibrium orientation presents a changeover related to the viscous elastic transition for viscoelastic materials  In particular  when the imposed oscillation period is lower than the characteristic turnover rate of the cytoskeleton and of adhesion molecules such as integrins  reorientation is significantly faster     0   Elsevier Inc ,Lucci G.; Giverso C.; Preziosi L.,Mathematical Biosciences
294,A simple model of immune and muscle cell crosstalk during muscle regeneration,Muscle injury during aging predisposes skeletal muscles to increased damage due to reduced regenerative capacity  Some of the common causes of muscle injury are strains  while other causes are more complex muscle myopathies and other illnesses  and even excessive exercise can lead to muscle damage  We develop a new mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations of muscle regeneration  It includes the interactions between the immune system  healthy and damaged myonuclei as well as satellite cells  Our new mathematical model expands beyond previous ones by accounting for    specific parameters  including those parameters that deal with the interactions between the damaged and dead myonuclei  the immune system  and the satellite cells  An important assumption of our model is the replacement of only damaged parts of the muscle fibers and the dead myonuclei  We conduce systematic sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters have larger effects on the model and therefore are more influential for the muscle regeneration process  We propose additional validation for these parameters  We further demonstrate that these simulations are species   muscle   and age dependent  In addition  the knowledge of these parameters and their interactions  may suggest targeting or selecting these interactions for treatments that accelerate the muscle regeneration process     0   The Authors,Kojouharov H.V.; Chen-Charpentier B.M.; Solis F.J.; Biguetti C.; Brotto M.,Mathematical Biosciences
295,Mathematically modeling the effect of touch frequency on the environmental transmission of Clostridioides difficile in healthcare settings,Clostridioides difficile  formerly Clostridium difficile  is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea and one of the most common healthcare acquired infections in United States hospitals  C  difficile persists well in healthcare environments because it forms spores that can survive for long periods of time and can be transmitted to susceptible patients through contact with contaminated hands and fomites  objects or surfaces that can harbor infectious agents  Fomites can be classified as high touch or low touch based on the frequency they are contacted  The mathematical model in this study investigates the relative contribution of high touch and low touch fomites on new cases of C  difficile colonization among patients of a hospital ward  The dynamics of transmission are described by a system of ordinary differential equations representing four patient population classes and two pathogen environmental reservoirs  Parameters that have a significant effect on incidence  as determined by a global sensitivity analysis  are varied in stochastic simulations of the system to identify feasible strategies to prevent disease transmission  Results indicate that on average  under one quarter of asymptomatically colonized patients are exposed to C  difficile via low touch fomites  In comparison  over three quarters of colonized patients are colonized through high touch fomites  despite additional cleaning of high touch fomites  Increased contacts with high touch fomites increases the contribution of these fomites to the incidence of colonized individuals and decreasing the duration of a hospital visit reduces the amount of pathogen in the environment  Thus  enhanced efficacy of disinfection upon discharge and extra cleaning of high touch fomites  reduced contact with high touch fomites  and higher discharge rates  among other control measures  could lead to a decrease in the incidence of colonized individuals     0   Elsevier Inc ,Sulyok C.J.; Fox L.; Ritchie H.; Lanzas C.; Lenhart S.; Day J.,Mathematical Biosciences
296,On how the power supply shapes microbial survival,Understanding how environmental factors affect microbial survival is an important open problem in microbial ecology  Patterns of microbial community structure have been characterized across a wide range of different environmental settings  but the mechanisms generating these patterns remain poorly understood  Here  we use mathematical modelling to investigate fundamental connections between chemical power supply to a system and patterns of microbial survival  We reveal a complex set of interdependences between power supply and distributions of survival probability across microbial habitats  in a case without interspecific resource competition  We also find that different properties determining power supply  such as substrate fluxes and Gibbs energies of reactions  affect microbial survival in fundamentally different ways  Moreover  we show how simple connections between power supply and growth can give rise to complex patterns of microbial survival across physicochemical gradients  such as pH gradients  Our findings show the importance of taking energy fluxes into account in order to reveal fundamental connections between microbial survival and environmental conditions  and to obtain a better understanding of microbial population dynamics in natural environments     0   The Authors,Diego D.; Hannisdal B.; Dahle H.,Mathematical Biosciences
297,Mechanistic gene networks inferred from single-cell data with an outlier-insensitive method,With advances in single cell techniques  measuring gene dynamics at cellular resolution has become practicable  In contrast  the increased complexity of data has made it more challenging computationally to unravel underlying biological mechanisms  Thus  it is critical to develop novel computational methods capable of dealing with such complexity and of providing predictive deductions from such data  Many methods have been developed to address such challenges  each with its own advantages and limitations  We present an iterative regression algorithm for inferring a mechanistic gene network from single cell data  especially suited to overcoming problems posed by measurement outliers  Using this regression  we infer a developmental model for the gene dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm embryo  Our results show that the predictive power of the inferred model is higher than that of other models inferred with least squares and ridge regressions  As a baseline for how well a mechanistic model should be expected to perform  we find that model predictions of the gene dynamics are more accurate than predictions made with neural networks of varying architectures and complexity  This holds true even in the limit of small sample sizes  We compare predictions for various gene knockouts with published experimental results  finding substantial qualitative agreement  We also make predictions for gene dynamics under various gene network perturbations  impossible in non mechanistic models     0  ,Han J.; Perera S.; Wunderlich Z.; Periwal V.,Mathematical Biosciences
298,Dynamics of partially mitigated multi-phasic epidemics at low susceptible depletion: phases of COVID-19 control in Italy as case study,To mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID  9 pandemic  world countries have resorted   though with different timing and intensities   to a range of interventions  These interventions and their relaxation have shaped the epidemic into a multi phase form  namely an early invasion phase often followed by a lockdown phase  whose unlocking triggered a second epidemic wave  and so on  In this article  we provide a kinematic description of an epidemic whose time course is subdivided by mitigation interventions into a sequence of phases  on the assumption that interventions are effective enough to prevent the susceptible proportion to largely depart from  00   or from any other relevant level   By applying this hypothesis to a general SIR epidemic model with age since infection and piece wise constant contact and recovery rates  we supply a unified treatment of this multi phase epidemic showing how the different phases unfold over time  Subsequently  by exploiting a wide class of infectiousness and recovery kernels allowing reducibility  either to ordinary or delayed differential equations   we investigate in depth a low dimensional case allowing a non trivial full analytical treatment also of the transient dynamics connecting the different phases of the epidemic  Finally  we illustrate our theoretical results by a fit to the overall Italian COVID  9 epidemic since March  0 0 till February  0   i e   before the mass vaccination campaign  This show the abilities of the proposed model in effectively describing the entire course of an observed multi phasic epidemic with a minimal set of data and parameters  and in providing useful insight on a number of aspects including e g   the inertial phenomena surrounding the switch between different phases     0   Elsevier Inc ,d'Onofrio A.; Manfredi P.; Iannelli M.,Mathematical Biosciences
299,Squaring within the Colless index yields a better balance index,The Colless index for bifurcating phylogenetic trees  introduced by Colless   9     is defined as the sum  over all internal nodes v of the tree  of the absolute value of the difference of the sizes of the clades defined by the children of v  It is one of the most popular phylogenetic balance indices  because  in addition to measuring the balance of a tree in a very simple and intuitive way  it turns out to be one of the most powerful and discriminating phylogenetic shape indices  But it has some drawbacks  On the one hand  although its minimum value is reached at the so called maximally balanced trees  it is almost always reached also at trees that are not maximally balanced  On the other hand  its definition as a sum of absolute values of differences makes it difficult to study analytically its distribution under probabilistic models of bifurcating phylogenetic trees  In this paper we show that if we replace in its definition the absolute values of the differences of clade sizes by the squares of these differences  all these drawbacks are overcome and the resulting index is still more powerful and discriminating than the original Colless index     0 0 Elsevier Inc ,Bartoszek K.; Coronado T.M.; Mir A.; Rosselló F.,Mathematical Biosciences

301,Analyzing the effects of observation function selection in ensemble Kalman filtering for epidemic models,The Ensemble Kalman Filter  EnKF  is a popular sequential data assimilation method that has been increasingly used for parameter estimation and forecast prediction in epidemiological studies  The observation function plays a critical role in the EnKF framework  connecting the unknown system variables with the observed data  Key differences in observed data and modeling assumptions have led to the use of different observation functions in the epidemic modeling literature  In this work  we present a novel computational analysis demonstrating the effects of observation function selection when using the EnKF for state and parameter estimation in this setting  In examining the use of four epidemiologically inspired observation functions of different forms in connection with the classic Susceptible Infectious Recovered  SIR  model  we show how incorrect observation modeling assumptions  i e   fitting incidence data with a prevalence model  or neglecting under reporting  can lead to inaccurate filtering estimates and forecast predictions  Results demonstrate the importance of choosing an observation function that well interprets the available data on the corresponding EnKF estimates in several filtering scenarios  including state estimation with known parameters  and combined state and parameter estimation with both constant and time varying parameters  Numerical experiments further illustrate how modifying the observation noise covariance matrix in the filter can help to account for uncertainty in the observation function in certain cases     0   Elsevier Inc ,Mitchell L.; Arnold A.,Mathematical Biosciences
302,Stochastic stem cell models with mutation: A comparison of asymmetric and symmetric divisions,In order to fulfill cell proliferation and differentiation through cellular hierarchy  stem cells can undergo either asymmetric or symmetric divisions  Recent studies pay special attention to the effect of different modes of stem cell division on the lifetime risk of cancer  and report that symmetric division is more beneficial to delay the onset of cancer  The fate uncertainty of symmetric division is considered to be the reason for the cancer delaying effect  In this paper we compare asymmetric and symmetric divisions of stem cells via studying stochastic stem cell models with mutation  Specially  by using rigorous mathematical analysis we find that both the asymmetric and symmetric models show the same statistical average  but the symmetric model shows higher fluctuation than the asymmetric model  We further show that the difference between the two models would be more remarkable for lower mutation rates  Our work quantifies the uncertainty of cell division and highlights the significance of stochasticity for distinguishing between different modes of stem cell division     0   Elsevier Inc ,Wu Z.; Wang Y.; Wang K.; Zhou D.,Mathematical Biosciences

304,Measuring differences between phenomenological growth models applied to epidemiology,Phenomenological growth models  PGMs  provide a framework for characterizing epidemic trajectories  estimating key transmission parameters  gaining insight into the contribution of various transmission pathways  and providing long term and short term forecasts  Such models only require a small number of parameters to describe epidemic growth patterns  They can be expressed by an ordinary differential equation  ODE  of the type C  t  f t C    for t 0  C 0  C0  where t is time  C t  is the total size of the epidemic  the cumulative number of cases  at time t  C0 is the initial number of cases  f is a model specific incidence function  and   is a vector of parameters  The current COVID  9 pandemic is a scenario for which such models are of obvious importance  In B rger et al    0 9  it is demonstrated that some PGMs are better at fitting data of specific epidemic outbreaks than others even when the models have the same number of parameters  This situation motivates the need to measure differences in the dynamics that two different models are capable of generating  The present work contributes to a systematic study of differences between PGMs and how these may explain the ability of certain models to provide a better fit to data than others  To this end a so called empirical directed distance  EDD  is defined to describe the differences in the dynamics between different dynamic models  The EDD of one PGM from another one quantifies how well the former fits data generated by the latter  The concept of EDD is  however  not symmetric in the usual sense of metric spaces  The procedure of calculating EDDs is applied to synthetic data and real data from influenza  Ebola  and COVID  9 outbreaks     0   Elsevier Inc ,Bürger R.; Chowell G.; Lara-Díaz L.Y.,Mathematical Biosciences

The effects of sampling schemes in systems biology applications,Computational and mathematical models in biology rely heavily on the parameters that characterize them  However  robust estimates for their values are typically elusive and thus a large parameter space becomes necessary for model study  particularly to make translationally impactful predictions  Sampling schemes exploring parameter spaces for models are used for a variety of purposes in systems biology  including model calibration and sensitivity analysis  Typically  random sampling is used  however  when models have a high number of unknown parameters or the models are highly complex  computational cost becomes an important factor  This issue can be reduced through the use of efficient sampling schemes such as Latin hypercube sampling  LHS  and Sobol sequences  In this work  we compare and contrast three sampling schemes   random sampling  LHS  and Sobol sequences   for the purposes of performing both parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration  In addition  we apply these analyses to different types of computational and mathematical models of varying complexity  a simple ODE model  a complex ODE model  and an agent based model  In general  the sampling scheme had little effect when used for calibration efforts  but when applied to sensitivity analyses  Sobol sequences exhibited faster convergence  While the observed benefit to convergence is relatively small  Sobol sequences are computationally less expensive to compute than LHS samples and also have the benefit of being deterministic  which allows for better reproducibility of results     0   Elsevier Inc ,Renardy M.; Joslyn L.R.; Millar J.A.; Kirschner D.E.,Mathematical Biosciences

315,Model reduction for initial value ODEs,Many physical phenomena in biology and physiology are described by mathematical models that comprise a system of initial value ordinary differential equations  Each differential equation may often be written as the sum of several terms  where each term represents a different physical entity  A wide range of techniques  ranging from heuristic observation to mathematically rigorous asymptotic analysis  may be used to simplify these equations allowing the identification of the key phenomena responsible for a given observed behaviour  In this study we extend an algorithm for automatically simplifying systems of initial value ordinary differential equations  Whiteley   0 0   that is based on a posteriori analysis of the full system of equations  Our extensions to the algorithm make the following contributions   i  each equation in a system of differential equations may be written as a finite sum of contributions  including the derivative term   and any one of these terms may be neglected  if it is appropriate to do so  in the simplified model  and  ii  a simplified model is generated that allows accurate prediction of one or more components of the solution at all times  These extensions are illustrated using examples drawn from enzyme kinetics and cardiac electrophysiology     0   Elsevier Inc ,Ambuehl A.; Whiteley J.P.,Mathematical Biosciences
